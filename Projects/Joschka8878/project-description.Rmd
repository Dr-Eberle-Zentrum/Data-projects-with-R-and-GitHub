## Project Objective

My project has three primary objectives. The first two of those are if (a) the majority of immigrants in Argentina benefit from the AUH (Universal Child Allowance) social welfare program, and (b) if the majority of the beneficiaries of the program are immigrants. The third objective (c) is to characterize the beneficiaries of this particular program. In other words, what trends in origin, age, gender, employment (if any), and education level of the recipients of the AUH exist.

## Background

In recent years, the current government of Argentina has been asserting that immigrants are the primary beneficiaries of various social welfare programs in Argentina. Although the survey does not explicitly ask whether an individual benefits from any social welfare programs, the survey can be used to determine eligibility for such programs. Following the example of Mariana Marchionni, I assume intention-to-treat, i.e. all those who are eligible also benefit from the program. By identifying whether an individual fulfills the social program's criteria, I am able to determine whether they (most likely) receive the benefits from the program or not.

## Data Set

The data set sources from the [Argentinian Department of Statistics](https://www.indec.gob.ar/indec/web/Institucional-Indec-BasesDeDatos). The survey is known as the EPH (The Permanent Household Survey), and I will be using data from 2016. The survey includes a general household section and individual section, the latter of which asks each household resident questions on background, employment, and income. Using these variables, I can identify the criteria for receiving the benefits from the AUH program, (details to be explained later) and then measure up the share of immigrants and non-immigrants eligible for the program. To assist with pulling the data from the database, I will use the package [eph](https://ropensci.github.io/eph/index.html).

## Data Manipulation Goals:

The first course of action is to identify the criteria for eligibility of receiving the AUH. In brief, the AUH is a cash transfer program aimed at unemployed and informal workers earning below minimum wage with children or dependents, somewhat similar to the German institution of "Kindergeld". Additionally, in Argentina, approximately 30% of minors receive the AUH, so it is a very well-known and widespread program. Note that, a household may receive multiple transfer payments, one for each child or dependent with a max of five. The survey contains information on the familial relation of house residents to one another, so the head of household and his/her spouse are the relevant individuals whose employment type will be analyzed. Using these guidelines, I can identify whether either of the parents/guardians are eligible to receive any (and how many) transfer payments.

## Data Visualization Goals:

Data visualization will be relatively simple bar graphs measuring (a) the percentage of immigrants who are eligible for the AUH vs. the percentage of non-immigrants eligible for the AUH; (b) the number of immigrants who are eligible for the AUH vs. the number of non-immigrants eligible for the AUH; and (c) of those who are eligible, what are the percentages based on gender, age group, country of origin (within South America), province of origin (if Argentinian), employment type (if employed), and education level (each being a separate graph). 

Here is a rough idea of my data visualization, with the y being the fraction or count and x being the categorical variables: ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210705121552/barplotcount.png)
