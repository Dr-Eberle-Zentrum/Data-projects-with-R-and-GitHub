## My solution to Gulmira´s project

#### **What I still have to do (if I find the time until Wednesday):**

-   Create the variable you described (for now, I used the “Percent”
    variable because I didn’t quite understand what you mean by the
    “Annual frequency” variable).

-   Make all the plots and legends the same size (at the moment, it
    looks quite messy because they all have different sizes).

-   “Round” the lines in the plot (I didn’t find how to do this, so I’ll
    have to look into it again).
