# Visualisation for grave stelae from Cyprus during the Roman Empire

During the Roman Empire grave reliefs across the empire show similarities but can differ depending on the exact area they were used in. This can be the case because of local traditions and influences from other regions.  
Here the focus should be on the stelae from Cyprus which were categorized and dated by the archaeologist Pogiatzi.The provided [CSV](StelaeCyprus.csv) was assembled by me (J. Roever) from the data described in Pogiatzi's book:

_E. Pogiatzi, Die Grabreliefs auf Zypern von der archaischen bis zur roemischen Zeit, Peleus 23 (Diss. Albert-Ludwigs-Universitaet Freiburg 2002, Moehnesee-Wamel 2003)_

The analysed  attributes are:

* `catNo`: number given to the stele in Pogiatzi's catalogue
* `epoch`: the epoch to which Pogiatzi dated the stele
* `type`: the type identified in Pogiatzi's classification
* `typeDesc`: description of the type
* `typeCertain`: indicator whether the type could be identified certainly or not, the latter usually due to only fragmentary conservation
* `location`: where the stele was found
* `locationType`: in which context the stele was found
* `paintedSurface`: description of painted areas
* `material`: the material the stele is made of

In some cases the data can be uncertain or incomplete because grave reliefs as well as other artifacts were found and/or excavated without modern archaeological methods.
(For further interpretation it is also important to be aware that usually not 100% of the artifacts are known and excavated.)

# Goal

The project should be the creation of plots to show how some of the attributes of the stelae might correlate with each other.
The first few of 124 observations are these:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

data <- read.csv("StelaeCyprus.csv", sep=';', header = TRUE)
head(data)

```

Attributes to plot together to see potential correlations, usually with how often certain attribute values occur together:

* `epoch - type`: How long is each type used? Are there overlaps?
* `epoch - type - material`: Are there any changes in the material that go along with the epoch and type?
* `epoch - type - painted(true/false)`: Are stelae only painted in certain epochs or depending on their type?
* (`epoch - location` (only if found in situ^[in situ: at the place it was originally used in ancient time], location accuracy might have to be discussed): Which locations are stelae found at in the different epochs?)
* (`epoch - locationType` (only if found in situ, data might not be inconclusive because of many unknown): Were certain types of location used more during certain epochs?)

The last two can be excluded for the time being. Because of the incomplete data the results might not be coherent enough for interpretation.

## Intermediates

In some cases the attribute values need to be made more consistent within the range they should reflect. 
The range of values for `material` might be condensed to the values of `local limestone, (local?) hard limestone and imported marble`.  To include `location` in plots it might be enough to use the name of the ancient site excluding more specific details, especially for cases in which the grave relief was found near the site without recording the specific place or similar.

It might be useful to prepare information like this before creating the actual plot:

![Stele types per region](steleTypeRegion.PNG)

## Visualisation

* When depicting the `type` inclusion of a legend for the description of the types
* On the axes the order to show `epoch` chronological
* On the axes the order to show `type` should be following the stages of development (= numeric/alphabetical, starting with `1a`)
