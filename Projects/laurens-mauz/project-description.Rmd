# Background

Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, there was a lot of talk about the dangers and especially the mortality rate of this new Virus. Mortality rates are interesting as they can highlight which countries had the most difficulties to combat the virus. Mortality rates may also provide some insight into the effectiveness of different measures to protect people from severe cases of the disease.

# Data

The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering has compiled epidemiological data since 22 January 2020 from various sources (WHO, NHC, CCDC...). They track confirmed cases of SARS-Cov-2 as well as deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2. They provide this data on their [Git-Hub page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) as a time series (time_series_covid19_confimed-global.csv and time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv).  
Important columns:  

* Province/State 
* Country/Region
* Lat (the latitude of the Country/Region) 
* Long (the longitude of the Country/Region) 
* confirmed cases/deaths (depending on which time series) for day x (e.g. 1/29/20)

|Province/State |Country/Region|Lat     |Long     |1/22/20|1/23/20|1/24/20|
|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
|               |Afghanistan   |33.93911|67.709953|0      |0      |0      |
|               |Albania       |41.1533 |20.1683. |0      |0      |0      |
|South Australia|Australia     |-34.9285|138.6007 |0      |0      |0      |

# Goal 

I am interested in the average mortality rates for the SARS-COV-2 virus at different stages of the pandemic for the US, Germany, Italy, Australia, China, South Korea, New Zealand, Senegal and to visualize the results with heat maps. 

### To do: 

- calculate the average mortality rate for the time-windows february-april and juni-september of 2020, 2021 and 2022 for the aforementioned countries from the time series. 

- visualize the average mortality rates for the aforementioned countries and for each time-window using a heat map (you will have to create six heat maps since there are six averages/time-windows)

The visualitzation should look somewhat like this:

I hope I was clear
