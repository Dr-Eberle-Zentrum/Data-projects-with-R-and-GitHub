## introduction

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to investigate the development of film industry throughout the past century. Potentially we can track the trends of movie genres, the popularity of different genres over time, and even what factors contribute to a "successful" film. In particular, "success" can be defined differently depending on individual interpretation - by revenue, by profit, by view ratings etc. I am (hope you are too) interested in seeing the secret of a film success.

## dataset

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.

(source: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data?select=movies_metadata.csv>)

The csv file (dataset) can be found [here](./movies_metadata.csv).

The columns are mostly self-explanatory, only that the `popularity` is a little bit tricky - it should be a score reflecting some rating attributes such as "Number of votes for the day", "Number of views for the day" (for more info please see [**Popularity**](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/popularity-and-trending)**.)** As far as I understand, the higher the score, the more popular it is regarded.

## data manipulation goals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Data Tidying**: Since not all columns are needed for this project, some can be disregarded in the first place. Also, some data is stored as JSON format so we have to extract the usable information first. Do not forget to check for duplicates or null values (e.g. does runtime 0 min or budget \$0 make sense?) .

-   **Data Wrangling**: Group the films by genres, year or language to analyse the how well the film did (in terms of revenue, ratings etc.)

-   Note 1: There are columns in JSON format, so make sure we use a proper json parser package to transform them into normal R data (good if a list column that can be unnested if needed)

## visualization goals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   number of films by year and country (use line chart)

-   number of genres through different year (use ridgeline plot)

-   correlation between revenue and budget (can also visualize whether it is a profit or loss in the end) (use scatter plot)

-   expected visualization looks like these:

Note: for the density plot the country needs not to be differentiated by line styles, but can also by colors.
