## General topic of task
Umschreiben damit es Aufgabenstellung ist

The aim of the project is to look at the expectations of 15-year-old students in terms of their educational qualifications. This should be done on the basis of parents parent's highest level of education in different countries.


## Data Set
Does dataset need preprocessing? What to do with NAs?

The dataset is from OECD and contains the answers of students in the PISA student questionnaire. PISA means Programme for International Student Assessment and measures 15-year old's mathematical, reading and writing competencies. The study is conducted every three years across all OECD countries. The datset to be used contains the student questionnaire, where they answered questions about themselves, their family, how they think about their life, their school and schedule. You can find the dataset here https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/ . To download the data yourself you need to go to the 'student questionnaire data file' in the 'SAS Data Files' section. This will download a zip folder with the (it took quite some time for me to download the data). 
If you ever need to import sas files, I'd advise you to use the haven package:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
library(haven)
# read_sas("cy08msp_stu_qqq.sas7bdat")
```
The whole datafile is actually so big I can't upload it to GitHub.

I therefore created a [datset](data_PISA.Rdata) containing only students from three different countries (Germany, Estonia, Japan; as can be seen beneath). I would advise you to work with this dataset instead of downloading the zip file.

Here is an [overview over the different variables](Codebook_PISA.SAS), but the pdf containing the [whole questionnaire](Projects/ArleneHohl/Questionnaire.pdf) might be more helpful.

## Data manipulation goals
To reach the project goal, I chose the countries Germany, Estonia and Japan to compare, as it aligns with the visualization goal you can find in the next paragraph.

The next step is to build the parent's highest level of education for every person.
To build this score, for this project you need the following items:
- parent's highest level of education mother (ST005Q01JA)
- parent's highest level of education mother (ST007Q01JA)
The lower the score is, the higher the completed education. I would reverse it so higher score = higher education. I would advise to then build a mean or sum score for the parents for every person. 

Now we also need the expected education qualification of the student, which is in the variables ST327Q01JA,ST327Q02JA, ST327Q03JA,..., ST327Q08JA. Each of these variables describes, if a person thinks they will reach this qualification (e.g. ST327Q01JA: ISCED level 2, 1= yes, 2 = no, 3 = don't know). I guess it makes the most sense to find the highest education qualification each person believes to achieve and store this in a new column (so for each person you need to find the last row where they said they would achieve this qualifiaction (=2)).

If you encounter any missing values, you are free to decide if you want to drop these objects or if you want to impute them.

## visualization goals & intermediates

I plan on creating a plot looking similar to this.
![something like this](plot_idea.png).

On the x-axis should be the parent's highest level of education, and on the y-axis should be the expected qualification of the student. We want one plot for each country. The plan is to first create the single plots for the different countries and then add them together. The circle size should be the amount of students believing to achieve this qualification. I also would like to have a line with the average of expected achieved qualifiaction across all countries in each plot. And feel free to make the plot a little prettier than the one I provided.
