## Whisky statistics

Since my last attempt at updating the project ended in something that still does not work, I will try it now with a statistic project related to whisky. The data set to be used in this project is available in the project folder as “Whisky.csv”.

The goal of this project is to visualize in a spider graph which region (column “Region:”) has which number of whiskies with a high rating (column “Punkte:”, more than 80). The spider graph should have the regions on the x-axis and the number of whiskies with a high rating on the y-axis. Every destillery (column “Destillerie:”) should get a different color graph (except red) The median rating should be calculated for each region. and displayed as a overlay spider diagram in red. It should have a title labeled “The quality of scotch whiskys in relation to the region of destillation and the median quality of each region” and the x-axis and y-axis should be labeled with the corresponding column names. Add a legend to the graph. Save the spider graph at the end as a .png file in the project folder.

## About the data sources

The data used in this project was manually entered into a electronic data processing system. The data sources are (partly) stated in the “Buch vom:” column.
