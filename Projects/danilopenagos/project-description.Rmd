# Project description

In the second half of the 20th century, the cultural field in Colombia underwent significant changes. One of the most important changes was the commercialization of art and the emergence of galleries and exhibitions for artists. This shift had a profound impact on the art scene in Colombia, allowing artists to showcase their work and establish themselves within the larger cultural sphere. As galleries and exhibitions proliferated, a new market for art emerged, creating opportunities for artists and collectors alike. This transformation of the cultural landscape represents an important turning point in the history of Colombian art and continues to shape the art world in the country to this day.

The general topic of our task is analyzing the art scene in Bogotá (Colombia) during the second half of the 20th century. We aim to gain insights into the relationships between art galleries, exhibitions, and artists during this time period, solving the question about the participation of the artists in the most notable exhibitions, and specifically which artists were connected with most important galleries in Bogotá.

Our data was collected by the [Banco de archivos gitales de Artes en Colombia](https://badac.uniandes.edu.co/). This is a multimedia repository of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the Universidad de los Andes that collects and disseminates physical and digital archives of the arts in Colombia, including plastic arts, audiovisual, music, literature, art history, art criticism, humanities, and cultural heritage. It contains digitized pieces and datasets.

In this case, the dataset about invitation to exhibitions of art, includes information about art galleries and artists, as well as relevant dates, locations, and publication information. However, these data are not yet organized, and it is up to us to consolidate them into a single dataset. The data are presented in separate spreadsheets for each decade from 1940 to 2018 (ie. "1940-1949", "1950-1959", and so on...), and our task is to merge and clean these data to create a comprehensive and coherent dataset for analysis.

## A first look to data

```{r invitations_data, echo=FALSE}
invitation_galleries <- read_excel("D:/Historia y Humanidades Digitales/R2 Course/Advanced-data-processing-with-R/Projects/danilopenagos/PG_BD_INVITACIONES_SM05-20-2021.xlsx")
knitr::kable(
  invitation_galleries[1:5,]
)
```

As you notice, names of variables are in Spanish, if you need some help, don't hesitate to tell me. [Deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/) is also a good option to translate (if it is necessary).

For our goals, most important variables are "Nombre, Galeria, Espacio" and "Artistas". These are the most complete variables. The variable "Código de galería" contains a normalized form for name of gallerias, which could also be useful. It is possible that in the case of artists, typos in the names may need to be corrected.

I do not have information about the red and yellow coloring of some rows in the data set.

It is important to notice the difference between the "date of publication" and "the date of inauguration" variables. The former is when the invitation to the exposition was published in particular media (i.e., newspaper), while the latter is when the exposition was inaugurated.

## Data wrangling

Combine the invitations data by decade in a new dataset (the last two spread can be deleted). Separate artists listed in the same cell to create individual entries for each artist. Then, create a subset focusing on the relationship between artists and galleries. Copy the artist and gallery columns into a new dataset, removing any duplicates.

To generate a file for the visualization, organize the dataset with unique identifiers for artists and galleries. Create a JSON object with nodes and edges arrays. Iterate through the dataset to populate the nodes array with artist and gallery information, also calculate weights (the number of times an artist presents his work at a gallery). Iterate again to create objects in the edges array, specifying the source (artist) and target (gallery) node identifiers, as well as the value (the weight of the relationship). Combine the arrays into a JSON object and save it as a .json file for visualization. An example of these kind of data can be found [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/christophergandrud/networkD3@master/JSONdata/energy.json).

## Visualization goals

Our visualization goals include exploring the relationships between art galleries and artists. In addition to visualizing these relationships, we may also utilize other types of graphs or charts to gain insights into different aspects of the data with a focus on identifying patterns and trends over time, as exhibition duration or visualize how many galleries and artists participated in the art scene of Bogotá over time and how their numbers changed.

Certainly, the person in charge of the data analysis and visualization can choose to focus on another topics. For example, they could examine the art critics who were active during this period by looking at the "press article" variable and identifying the different media outlets where the articles were published.

One of our references is the following:

![Making the University of Miami School of Architecture, Gilda Santana & Alissa Fowers (2019)](https://dataanddragons.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/archgenealogy-proof.png?w=783&h=1024)

However, a more realistic goal (that does not include editing in external software) could be the following Sankey diagram:

![Rawgraph of Making the University of Miami School of Architecture](https://dataanddragons.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/rawgraphs2.png)

In our case, we will focus on exploring the connection among artist and gallery, and we could choose the most representative artists in the dataset or galleries (i.e., only artists with three or more exhibitions). The documentation for this type of visualization can be found at [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/sankey.html "Sankey Diagram").

In the final graphic, in addition to the corresponding colors and labels, a title should be included and the artist with the highest participation and the gallery with the most exhibitions should be highlighted. Be creative with the latter.

In brief, our visualization roadmap includes: - Cleaning and organizing the dataset - Creating a diagram to visualize the relationships between art galleries and artists, with colors and labels. - Using other types of graphs or charts as needed to explore different aspects of the data (i.e. timeline duration of exhibition).

Looking forward to see your contributions.

Best regards,

Danilo P.
