# First Project: Drafting a description of the project

The goal of this project is to work with Covid-data in the EU. The data has informations on the new daily number of reported COVID-19 cases (Neuansteckungen, a person is only counting once per Covid-illness as "case") and deaths for every EU/EEA country.
The data set starts at the beginning of the pandemic until the 01.11.2022. After this date, the covid cases are not tracked anymore in all country.

The data can be downloaded from the following link:
<https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-daily-new-cases-covid-19-eueea-country>
Please download the data as xlsx-file. 


## More detailed informations about the dataset

The dataset includes data for all EU/EEA country. The cases and the deaths are listed per day. In the column popData2020 you can find the population of the respective country in the year 2020. Take attention to proper handle the NA-values. Mostly at the end of the data recording their could be countries who stopped the data transmission already earlier.

Small view in the data set:
```{r, echo = F}
cases = "D:/Eric/Documents/Uni_Tuebingen_Kurse/5. Semester/Kurs R2/Project1/Covid_Cases_EU.xlsx"
ca = read_excel(cases)
head(ca)
```

## Work to do

We want to find out, which EU-country has the most cumulative covid-cases and deaths proportional to the number of inhabitants over the entire period of the Covid-pandemic. Therefore you need to create a bar chart *geom_bar()*. On the X-axis of the chart, the different EU-countries should be listed (exclude the countries which are not part of the EU!!). The Y-axis should visualize the covid-cases. The chart-bars should also include the number of deaths. Due to the high discrepancy between the "cases" and the "deaths", you should find an adequat method to also visualize the deaths. Herefore on possibility would be to group the number of deaths in different categories and to color the boxplot in relation to the respective category (color gradient). Or you can work. It`s also fine to search for a different option, like numbers in the bars, etc....
Take care to show the cases and deaths in relation to the population of the countries, mention this also in the legend. The relation should be in a way, that you divide the total number of daily cases per country with the population number of that country. 

##Optional Task

For those who want to go a little farer. You can try to find out if there is a relation between the Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and the total daily covid-cases in this country over the entire period. One possibility to do this could be by testing the correlation between the two variables and later on creating a Scatterplot that shows the distribution and gives us a correlation coefficient.
