## Description

This dataset accompanies a study examining the relationship between xerostomia (dry mouth) and salivary cortisol levels in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Data were collected from MS patients diagnosed according to the McDonald Criteria, with saliva samples taken at 10:00 AM to measure cortisol levels using an ELISA kit. The dataset includes xerostomia assessments, medication use, anxiety scores, and statistical analyses to explore cortisol as a potential biomarker for xerostomia in MS patients.



## Dataset

```{r goal}
kable(head(data, 1))
```

The [dataset](data_MS.csv) is taken from [Harvard Dataverse]( https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/APVJSO) and is publicly available. There is just data from MS patients in there and therfore no control group.

BAI stands for Beck-Anxiety-Inventory and it is a widely used self-report questionnaire designed to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms in adults and adolescents.

The Abslang test is a quick, simple test where a patient bites down on a tongue depressor; the inability to hold the blade or pain during the bite suggests a possible mandible (jawbone) fracture (0-negative, 1-positive).


### Priority for the tasks is indicated by  the number of "+".
* (+++) -> very important
* (++) -> important
* (+) -> less important

### Data Manipulation
* MS Duration should be given in months as an integer. (+++)
* Create a new column whether the patient has other conditions encoded with the number of the diseases, so no other diseases means 0 ... (++)
* Create a new column whether the Patient is treated with a Corticosteroid (+++) and another whether the patient is treated with a B-cell depleting therapy (Rituximab). (+)
* Replace the column with clear names with a column where patients are coded according to the scheme MS_XS_0xx.(+)

### Visualisation goals 
* Plot the BAI Score against the Cortisol Test Result as a scatter plot, color-coded by sex and using different shapes to indicate corticosteroid intake. (+++)
* Determine the correlation value for all subgroups (4: female(f)Corticosteroid intake+(+);f-,male(m)+,m- ) and plot the linear regression lines on the graph (+)
* Divide the patients into MS duration groups with 6-month intervals and create a chart showing the average NO test value as a point and the standard deviation as an error bar for each group.(++)
* Divide the patients into age groups with an interval of 15 years and crate a bar chart showing the median number of diseases for each of these age groups. Keep in mind that MS is also counted as a disease.(++)
