# Project Descriptions

## Plot 1: NVIDIA Stock Analysis

### Introduction
In this project, we aim to analyze the stock performance of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) over time. Understanding how NVIDIA's stock has behaved historically can provide valuable insights for investors and analysts.

### Data Set
We obtained the stock data from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history). This dataset contains historical stock information, including the date and closing price.

```{r}
# Read the CSV file and display the head of the data
data <- read.csv("NVDA.csv", header=TRUE)
head(data)
```
### Data Manipulation Goals
Our data manipulation goals include:
1. Converting the 'Date' column to a proper date format to facilitate time-based analysis.
2. Calculating monthly closing values from the dataset to identify trends and patterns in the stock performance over time.

### Visualization Goals
Our goal is to create visualizations illustrating the monthly stock performance of NVIDIA. We aim to produce two plots:
1. A plot with a logarithmic scale to highlight percentage changes over time.
2. A plot with a linear scale to provide a clear representation of absolute stock values.

### Packages Used
We utilized the following R packages for our analysis:
- `lubridate`: For handling date data effectively.
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation tasks.
- `ggplot2`: For creating visually appealing plots.
- `cowplot`: For arranging multiple plots.

### Hint 
```{r}
#example for usage of cowplot library:
library(cowplot)

# 2 example plots:
plot1 <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Plot 1")

plot2 <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Plot 2")

# plots next to each other
plot_grid(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2)
```

## Plot 2: Average Weekly Performance Analysis

### Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the average weekly performance of NVIDIA. Weekly performance analysis can provide insights into short-term trends and volatility in NVIDIA's stock price.

### Data Set
We utilized the same dataset from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history), containing historical stock information.

### Data Manipulation Goals
Our data manipulation goals include:
1. Converting the 'Date' column to a proper date format for accurate time-based analysis.
2. Grouping the data by week and year to analyze weekly performance trends.
3. Calculating the average weekly performance to identify average performance levels over time.

### Visualization Goals
Our aim is to visualize the average weekly performance per year using a line plot. This visualization will provide a clear representation of how NVIDIA's stock has performed on average on a weekly basis over different years.

### Packages Used
We employed the following R packages for our analysis:
- `lubridate`: For handling date data efficiently.
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation tasks.
- `ggplot2`: For creating insightful visualizations.
