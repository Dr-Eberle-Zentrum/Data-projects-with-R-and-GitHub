# US Immigrant Visas Issued Project

## Project Assets

original information from the US Department of State: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/annual-reports.html

relevant data: *Table III: Immigrant Visas Issued (by Foreign State of Chargeability or Place of Birth): Fiscal Year YYYY*

## Data Wrangling Goal

I would like to be able to extract the data from the PDF files themselves without having to first import the data into Excel via Power Query. Take a look at the function ```pdf_text()``` from the package ```pdftools```. If you cannot make it happen, then use the Excel files. However, the priority is to be able to get the data from the pdf files! 

```{r, echo = T}
colnamesSet <- c("state", "immediateRel", "specialImm", "famPref", "employPref", "divImm", "total")

# list taken from https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/visa-issuing-posts.html
# modified in Excel and Notepad++ to get strings
# (would be better to somehow use rworldmap::countrySynonyms or similar to check if a string is a country name)
# INCOMPLETE, does not list every entry listed in the documents
# some INCORRECT/CHANGED e.g. "United Kingdom" is "Great Britain and North Ireland" in the files
listCountries <- tolower(c("Afghanistan","Albania","Algeria","Angola","Argentina","Armenia","Australia","Austria","Azerbaijan","Bahamas","Bahrain","Bangladesh","Barbados","Belarus","Belgium","Belize","Benin","Bermuda","Bolivia","Bosnia And Herzegovina","Botswana","Brazil","Brunei","Bulgaria","Burkina Faso","Burma","Burundi","Cabo Verde","Cambodia","Cameroon","Canada","Central African Republic","Chad","Chile","China","Colombia","Congo, Democratic Republic Of The","Congo, Republic Of The","Costa Rica","Cote D'ivoire","Croatia","Cuba","Cyprus","Czech Republic","Denmark","Djibouti","Dominican Republic","Ecuador","Egypt","El Salvador","Equatorial Guinea","Eritrea","Estonia","Ethiopia","Fiji","Finland","France","Gabon","Gambia, The","Georgia","Germany","Ghana","Greece","Guatemala","Guinea","Guyana","Haiti","Honduras","Hong Kong","Hungary","Iceland","India","Indonesia","Iraq","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Jamaica","Japan","Jordan","Kazakhstan","Kenya","Korea, South","Kosovo","Kuwait","Kyrgyzstan","Laos","Latvia","Lebanon","Lesotho","Liberia","Libya","Lithuania","Luxembourg","Macedonia","Madagascar","Malawi","Malaysia","Mali","Malta","Marshall Islands","Mauritania","Mauritius","Mexico","Micronesia","Moldova","Mongolia","Montenegro","Morocco","Mozambique","Namibia","Nepal","Netherlands","New Zealand","Nicaragua","Niger","Nigeria","Norway","Oman","Pakistan","Palau","Panama","Papua New Guinea","Paraguay","Peru","Philippines","Poland","Portugal","Qatar","Romania","Russia","Rwanda","Samoa","Saudi Arabia","Senegal","Serbia","Sierra Leone","Singapore","Slovakia","Slovenia","South Africa","South Sudan","Spain","Sri Lanka","Sudan","Suriname","Swaziland","Sweden","Switzerland","Syria","Taipei, Taiwan (TAI/TAI)","Tajikistan","Tanzania","Thailand","Timor-Leste","Togo","Trinidad And Tobago","Tunisia","Turkey","Turkmenistan","Uganda","Ukraine","United Arab Emirates","United Kingdom","Uruguay","USUN","Uzbekistan","Venezuela","Vietnam","Yemen","Zambia","Zimbabwe"))

  # old/manual reducement to relevant rows
  # data <- data[ grep(strList[1], data) : grep(strList[length(strList)], data) ] 
  
  # keep rows from data when the start of the row equals one of the entries in listCountries)
  data <- data[tolower(str_extract(pattern = "[:alpha:]+\\w{2,}", data)) %in% listCountries]

  # turn into df with fixed number of columns, by dividing along the whitespaces between values
  data <- data.frame(str_split_fixed(data, " {2,}", 7))
  colnames(data) <- colnamesSet
  data$continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = data[, "state"], origin = "country.name", destination = "continent")

```

## Tidy Data Format Goal

Below, you will find two pictures of the data (I used the country Algeria and the fiscal year 2000 as an example. However, this applies to every country and every fiscal year).
The first picture shows the original data provided by the Department of State. As you can see, the data is in PDF format and is not tidy! I colored the relevant information that I would like to extract in different colors:

- Fiscal_Year = Yellow
- Country = Green
- Continent = Red
- Visa_Type = Blue
- Issued = Pink

![Goal Tidy Data Format](Original_Data_Format.png)

The following picture shows how the final table should look like. Again, I used the same colors to highlight how the data should be shown in tidy format (The color of the values in both screenshots is pink but comes across as if they have different colors so don't be confused).

There should only be one single table in long format that has all the information of every year for each country.

## Goal Data Visualization

Once the data is tidy, I would like to be able to visualize how many visas were issued by country & visa category over time. For that purpose, I would like to somehow define a specific country that I am interested in (Maybe in a dashboard or simply a variable that I can change) and generate a graph. This could look something like this:

Please create the above graph for the following countries:

- Germany
- China
- Mexico
- India
