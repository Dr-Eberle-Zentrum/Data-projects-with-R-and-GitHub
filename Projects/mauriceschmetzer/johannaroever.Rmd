relevant data: *Table III: Immigrant Visas Issued (by Foreign State of Chargeability or Place of Birth): Fiscal Year YYYY*

## Data Wrangling Goal

I would like to be able to extract the data from the PDF files themselves without having to first import the data into Excel via Power Query. Take a look at the function ```pdf_text()``` from the package ```pdftools```. If you cannot make it happen, then use the Excel files. However, the priority is to be able to get the data from the pdf files! 

```{r, echo = F}
# colnamesSet <- c("state", "Immediate Relatives", "Special Immigrants", "Family Preference", "Employment Preference", "Diversity Immigrants", "total")
# 
# # list taken from xslx files
# # modified in Excel and Notepad++ to get strings
# # (would be better to somehow use rworldmap::countrySynonyms or similar to check if a string is a country name)
# # INCOMPLETE, does not list every entry listed in the documents
# listCountries <- factor(tolower(c("Algeria","Angola","Benin","Botswana","Burkina Faso","Burundi","Cameroon","Cape Verde","Central African Republic","Chad","Comoros","Congo, Republic of the","Congo, Democratic Republic of the","Cote d’Ivoire","Djibouti","Egypt","Equatorial Guinea","Eritrea","Ethiopia","Gabon","Gambia","Ghana","Guinea","Guinea-Bissau","Kenya","Lesotho","Liberia","Libya","Madagascar","Malawi","Mali","Mauritania","Mauritius","Morocco","Mozambique","Namibia","Niger","Nigeria","Rwanda","Sao Tome and Principe","Senegal","Seychelles","Sierra Leone","Somalia","South Africa","Sudan","Swaziland","Tanzania","Togo","Tunisia","Uganda","Zambia","Zimbabwe","Afghanistan","Bahrain","Bangladesh","Bhutan","Brunei","Burma","Cambodia","China−mainland born","−Taiwan born","Hong Kong Special","Administrative Region","India","Indonesia","Iran","Iraq","Israel","Japan","Jordan","Korea, North","Korea, South","Kuwait","Laos","Lebanon","Malaysia","Maldives","Mongolia","Nepal","Oman","Pakistan","Philippines","Qatar","Saudi Arabia","Singapore","Sri Lanka","Syria","Thailand","United Arab Emirates","Vietnam","Yemen","Albania","Andorra","Armenia","Austria","Azerbaijan","Belarus","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Croatia","Cyprus","Czech Republic","Denmark","Greenland","Estonia","Finland","France","French Guiana","French Polynesia","French Southern and Antarctic","Lands","Guadeloupe","Martinique","New Caledonia","Reunion","St. Pierre and Miquelon","Wallis and Futuna","Georgia","Germany","Great Britain and Northern Ireland","Anguilla","Bermuda","British Virgin Islands","Cayman Islands","Falkland Islands","Gibraltar","Montserrat","Pitcairn","St. Helena","Turks and Caicos Islands","Northern Ireland (DV only)","Greece","Hungary","Iceland","Ireland","Italy","Kazakhstan","Kyrgyzstan","Latvia","Liechtenstein","Lithuania","Luxembourg","Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav","Republic of","Malta","Moldova","Monaco","Netherlands","Aruba","Netherlands Antilles","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Macau","Romania","Russia","San Marino","Serbia-Montenegro","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","Western Sahara","Sweden","Switzerland","Tajikistan","Turkey","Turkmenistan","Ukraine","Uzbekistan","Vatican City","Antigua and Barbuda","Bahamas","Barbados","Belize","Canada","Costa Rica","Cuba","Dominica","Dominican Republic","El Salvador","Grenada","Guatemala","Haiti","Honduras","Jamaica","Mexico","Nicaragua","Panama","Saint Kitts and Nevis","Saint Lucia","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","Trinidad and Tobago","Australia","Christmas Island","Cocos Islands","Fiji","Kiribati","Marshall Islands","Micronesia, Federated States of","Nauru","New Zealand","Cook Islands","Niue","Palau","Papua New Guinea","Samoa","Solomon Islands","Tonga","Tuvalu","Vanuatu","Argentina","Bolivia","Brazil","Chile","Colombia","Ecuador","Guyana","Paraguay","Peru","Suriname","Uruguay","Venezuela"

## Tidy Data Format Goal

Below, you will find two pictures of the data (I used the country Algeria and the fiscal year 2000 as an example. However, this applies to every country and every fiscal year).
The first picture shows the original data provided by the Department of State. As you can see, the data is in PDF format and is not tidy! I colored the relevant information that I would like to extract in different colors:

- Fiscal_Year = Yellow
- Country = Green
- Continent = Red
- Visa_Type = Blue
- Issued = Pink

![Goal Tidy Data Format](Original_Data_Format.png)



The following picture shows how the final table should look like. Again, I used the same colors to highlight how the data should be shown in tidy format (The color of the values in both screenshots is pink but comes across as if they have different colors so don't be confused).

There should only be one single table in long format that has all the information of every year for each country.
![Goal Tidy Data Format](Goal_Tidy_Data_Format.png)

```{r, echo = T}
# add column Fiscal_Year in code chunk before for future structure with function to extract from more than one file
# fileData$Fiscal_Year <- str_extract(str_extract(pdfText[1], pattern = ".*Fiscal Year \\d{4}"), "\\d{4}")

# pivot to long table
# TODO exclude column "total" cause not necessary
data <- pivot_longer(fileData, 
                     cols = c("Immediate Relatives", "Special Immigrants", "Family Preference", "Employment Preference", "Diversity Immigrants"), 
                     names_to = "Visa_Type", values_to = "Issued")
head(data)
```

## Goal Data Visualization

Once the data is tidy, I would like to be able to visualize how many visas were issued by country & visa category over time. For that purpose, I would like to somehow define a specific country that I am interested in (Maybe in a dashboard or simply a variable that I can change) and generate a graph. This could look something like this:

![Goal Tidy Data Format](German_Historic_Immigrant_Visa_Graph.png)
Please create the above graph for the following countries:

- Germany
- China
- Mexico
- India

**TODO**
* **Diagrams are not calculating right on y-axis**
* **Currently only one year shown**
