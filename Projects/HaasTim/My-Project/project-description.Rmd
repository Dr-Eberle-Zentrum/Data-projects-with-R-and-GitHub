# General Topic

For this project we are examining the influence of the Covid-19 Pandemic on bilateral trade for Germany.

# Data sets

In order to examine the differences in trade we will look at one data set from 2019 and one from 2020. These data sets are available on Harvard's Database and public for everyone. You can find them [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T4CHWJ)

There is also a table about the HS-2Digit-code and its corresponding code name which I still had from a previous course.

# Data manipulation

1.  For both bilateral data sets: We are only interested in the overall product category and not the specific kind of product. Therefore, you should simplify the 6-digit product code by keeping the first two digits and then accumulate all products together (for each trading partner) which have the same two digits. Rename this column to "2digitcode"

2.  Merge both data sets so that we have both export and import levels from 2019 and 2020 in the same row for each country/product combination.

3.  Merge this new dataset with the HS_2Digit_List together (across the 2 digit code), so we have a product category for each code

# Visualization Goals

## First Graph

Now we are only interested in the differences in export and import between 2019 and 2020 across all product categories. To do this, we summarize the 2-digit code across all trading partners.

We are also creating 2 new columns ("Export_Diff" and "Import_Diff") from the perspective of 2020 to display the differences in trade for each product category.

Our goal is to visualize the top five trade differences in product categories (in absolute terms) for imports and exports. For our purposes we will use a Circular stacked Barchart. ![](Circular%20stacked%20Barchart.png)

## Second Graph

Now let's look at the trade differences at the trade partners level. To do this, we summarize the imports and exports (for 2019 and 2020) across all product categories for each country. In the next step we create a new column "Total Trade Difference", which sums up the exports and imports for 2019 and 2020 respectively and then calculates the difference (again from the perspective of 2020)

The objective is to display the Top10 trading partners with the highest "Total Trade Difference" (in absolute terms) by using a Choropleth Map. You can find more information about it [here](https://r-graph-gallery.com/183-choropleth-map-with-leaflet.html)
