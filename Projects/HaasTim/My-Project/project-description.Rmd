# General Topic

For this project we are examining the **influence of the Covid-19 Pandemic on bilateral trade for Germany**.

# Data sets

In order to examine the differences in trade we will look at one data set from **2019** and one from **2020**. The original data sets are available on Harvard's Database and public for everyone. If you are interested you can find them [**here**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T4CHWJ). However, the data set provided within the project is a manipulated version (removed unimportant columns and selected Germany (DEU) as the only "location_code").

```{r}
library(haven)
Data2019 <- read_dta("~/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub2/Projects/HaasTim/My-Project/Data2019.dta")
First10 <- head(Data2019, 5)
print(First10)

```

I think the first 5 column are pretty straightforward and self-explaining. The sixth one is about product codes. Each six-digit number gives you a product for example, **"040500"** translates to butter.

There is also a table about the **HS-2Digit-code** and its corresponding code name which I still had from a previous course. This table is very helpful because, we are not interested in a certain product rather in a product category. To follow up on the previous example, "**040500"** belongs to the"**04"** product category which describes: DAIRY PRODUCE; BIRDS' EGGS; NATURAL HONEY; EDIB

# Data manipulation

1.  For both bilateral data sets: We are only interested in the overall product category and not the specific kind of product. Therefore, you should **simplify** the 6-digit product code by keeping the first two digits and then **accumulate** all products together (for each trading partner) which have the same two digits. **Rename** this column to "2-digit_code"

2.  **Merge** both data sets so that we have both export and import levels from 2019 and 2020 in the same row for each **country/product combination**.

3.  **Merge** this new dataset with the HS_2Digit_List together (across the 2 digit code), so we have a product category for each code

# Visualization Goals

## First Graph

Now, we are only interested in the differences in export and import between 2019 and 2020 across all product categories. To do this, we **summarize** the 2-digit code across all trading partners.

We are also **creating** 2 new columns ("Export_Diff" and "Import_Diff") from the perspective of 2020 to display the differences in trade for each product category.

Our goal is to **visualize** the top five trade differences in product categories (in absolute terms) for imports and exports (5 for imports and 5 for exports. For our purposes we will use a Circular stacked Barchart. ![](Circular%20stacked%20Barchart.png).

**Labelling the graph:**

1.  Utilize four distinct colors:
    -   Red and Green to indicate negative and positive trade differences, respectively.

    -   Two shades of Red and Blue to differentiate between imports and exports.
2.  Label each bar with its corresponding code name, using shortened versions where applicable (e.g., "04" for Dairy Produces).
3.  Create a legend to explain the meaning of the four colors and also add a headline to the chart.

## Second Graph

Now let's look at the trade differences at the trade partners level. To do this, we summarize the imports and exports (for 2019 and 2020) across all product categories for each country. In the next step we create a new column "Total Trade Difference", which sums up the exports and imports for 2019 and 2020 respectively and then calculates the difference (again from the perspective of 2020).

This graph is optional as it requires HTML output. If graphing is not preferred just create a table for the same purpose. The objective is to showcase the Top10 trading partners with the highest "Total Trade Difference" (in absolute terms) by using a Choropleth Map.
