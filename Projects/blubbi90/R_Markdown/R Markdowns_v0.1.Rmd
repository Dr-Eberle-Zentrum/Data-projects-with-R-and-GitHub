## **Reproduce this super nice chart!**

It is often that you find a chart that you really like but have no idea how to do. An example might be the following one (click to enlarge).  


[<img src="https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png" alt="Bildbeschreibung" width="300"/>](https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png)


Which is shown and detailed on <https://ourworldindata.org>.


## **Goal of the project<span class="invisible-link">[ðŸ”—](#goal)</span>**


The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible using `ggplot` and the data available in the provided [CSV file](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv) with the following content (first lines):



```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)

# Lies die Daten
IceAge <- read.csv("https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv", encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
IceAge <- head(IceAge, 5)

kable(IceAge)

```


### **Visualization priorities (from high to low)<span class="invisible-link">[ðŸ”—](#goal)</span>**

* line style with animal name labels
* percent labels at line ends
* time range label at line start
* x-axis marks
* arrow line style
* annotation of brown bear
* text coloring
* relative font sizes
* animal symbol for brown bear [![Brown Bear](https://dr-eberle-zentrum.github.io/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/Projects/martin-raden/icons8-bear-67.png)](https://dr-eberle-zentrum.github.io/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/Projects/martin-raden/icons8-bear-67.png)


Letâ€™s see how close you can get! As a starting point, you might want to have a look at [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/).

Looking forward to see your solutions!

Best, Martin
