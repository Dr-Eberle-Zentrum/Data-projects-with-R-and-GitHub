# data manipulation
After the necessary packages an the dataset were loaded the dataset was cleaned up by removing all Na's and datasets that contain Na's.\n
After that the data will be summarized by the 'id' of the patient with mean and deviation of 'stressed_24h','stressed_moment', 'depressed', 'satisfied', 'motivated' and 'aroused'.
Then the same is made by grouping the data by 'group'.
```{r data cleaning,echo=FALSE}
data <- data %>%  
  select(-17) %>% 
  filter(if_all(-c(id_dOC, dOC_cycle_date, dOC_cycle_day), ~ !is.na(.)))
```
```{r data aggregation,include=FALSE}
# Give out a tibble containing the mean and standard deviation for each mood and stress item for each participant
data %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(mean_stressed_24h = mean(stressed_24h),
            SD_stressed_24h = sd(stressed_24h),
            mean_stressed_moment = mean(stressed_moment),
            SD_stressed_moment = sd(stressed_moment),
            mean_depressed = mean(depressed),
            SD_depressed = sd(depressed),
            mean_satisfied = mean(satisfied),
            SD_satisfied = sd(satisfied),
            mean_motivated = mean(motivated),
            SD_motivated = sd(motivated),
            mean_aroused = mean(aroused),
            SD_aroused = sd(aroused))

# Give out a tibble containing the mean and standard deviation for each mood and stress item for each group
data %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_stressed_24h = mean(stressed_24h),
            SD_stressed_24h = sd(stressed_24h),
            mean_stressed_moment = mean(stressed_moment),
            SD_stressed_moment = sd(stressed_moment),
            mean_depressed = mean(depressed),
            SD_depressed = sd(depressed),
            mean_satisfied = mean(satisfied),
            SD_satisfied = sd(satisfied),
            mean_motivated = mean(motivated),
            SD_motivated = sd(motivated),
            mean_aroused = mean(aroused),
            SD_aroused = sd(aroused))
```
Then the  correlation between a stress moment and the a positive and negative mood is created with the stress moment beeing 'stressed_moment' and the positive/negative mood beeing 'motivated'/'tense'.

# Visualization
The visualization of the participants mood and stress are shown during weekdays.\n
The result shows that the majority of all medication starter **sOC** is feeling most depressed at the middle of the week (Th). \n
For the **dOC** group the mood varies much more during the week.
For the **OC** group the mood varies even less and is even is better in comparison to **doc**.

## Kommentar:
Sorry that I couldn't add the Tier 2 plots yet.
