# Self-control, sleep quality and smartphone usage 

* Data: data_smaschkon_2023-02-11_09-11.xlsx
* Variables: variables_smaschkon_2023-02-11_09-24.csv
* Values: values_smaschkon_2023-02-11_09-24.csv

The data was collected as part of a data collection seminar. The aim was to investigate the relationship between self-control, sleep quality and smartphone usage. 

The following columns (so-called "items") are relevant for my project:

* Sleep quality: 
"PS03_01"

* Self-control: 
"SC01_14", "SC01_02", "SC01_03", "SC01_04", "SC01_05", "SC01_06", 
"SC01_07", "SC01_08", "SC01_09", "SC01_10", "SC01_11", "SC01_12",
"SC01_13"

  * Attention! Item "SC01_09" must be "recoded"!
  * Find out what this means and adjust accordingly.

* Smartphone Usage:
"TS01_01", "TS01_02", "TS01_03", "TS01_04", "TS01_05", "TS01_06",
"TS01_07", "TS01_08", "TS01_09", "TS01_10", "TS01_11", "TS01_12",
"TS01_13", "TS01_14", "TS01_15", "TS01_16", "TS01_17", "TS01_18",
"TS01_19"

  * Attention! Error with "TS01_17"! 
  * What is wrong here? Pay attention to which values are possible and        which values can actually be found in the column (e.g. with the           "table()" function). Make appropriate adjustments.


# How do I create a scale/variable?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# For example 3 Items
data <- data.frame(item1 = c(4, 2, 3, 1), # You good in math?
                   item2 = c(4, 2, 3, 1), # You like math?
                   item3 = c(3, 3, 3, 2)) # You want to work on something that requires math skills

# Simple (but not necessarily the most efficient) way:

item123 <-c("item1", "item2", "item3") # building vector

data$variable <-rowMeans(data[,item123]) # creating variable by building Means at each row

head(data) # quick check
```


# Aim of the project

I would like to have a cool graphic in which you can see the connection between self-control and smartphone use. The study participants should be divided into groups for the graph: The groups should result from the answers to item "PS03_01". 

I have tried to create a graph but I just can't get it any better than this:

Please try to recreate the graphic and add colors that are easier to distinguish, a legend, a clear axis label and choose a nice theme. Good luck!
