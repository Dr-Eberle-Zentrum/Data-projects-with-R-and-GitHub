## General Topic of the Task
Subjects that filled out a personality questionnaire. 

## The Dataset
* what is it
Dataset contains the scores for the simple items and the calculated scales belonging to the questionnaire
* origin
Data was collected for a Swedish study I am now working on
* important information on what is what
SSP01-SSP91 are the simple item scores, R is for reversed item score
SSPSTA-SSPET are the scores for the 13 scales
SSPTSTA-SSPTET are the t-transformed scores for the 13 scales

## Data Manipulation Goals
I would like to have a dataset with only persons that do not have any missing data.
3 factor scores should be calculated (with the t-scored scales).
Unnecessary variables should be removed

## Data Visualization Goals

## About the Data
The data contains information about soil. Soil samples where taken from soil profiles somewhere in the Naturpark Schönbuch and analysed in a laboratory. Each soil profile consists of several horizons and samples where taken from every horizon, so the rows represent the horizonts of all the profiles. The data table comes as .csv file but was not managed well, which means there is some cleaning to do.

## Columns explained
- `Labornummer Tübingen`: individual sample number
- `Profil_2`: number of profile
- `Horizont_43`: number of horizon (per profile)
- `Tiefe_44`: accumulated depth of the horizons
- `Horizontbezeichnung_45`: type of horizon
- `East_84`: Coordinates "Easting" in meters (UTM coordinates)
- `North_85`: Coordinates "Northing" in meters (UTM coordinates)
- `Neigung_16`: slope
- `Expozition_17`: direction (N, NE, ...)
- `Corg`: percentage of organic carbon
- `CaCO3`: percentage of carbonate
- `Ca`, `Mg`, `K`, `Na`: calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium
- `Kationen`: cations
- `KAKpot`, `KAKpot2`: potential cation exchange capacity - same data but KAKpot2 has the decimal point at the wrong location
- `gS`, `mS`, `fS`, `S`: coarse, middle and fine fraction of sand - added together to Sand (S)
- `gU`, `mU`, `fU`, `U`: coarse, middle and fine fraction of silt - added together to silt (U)
- `gT`, `mT+fT`, `T`: coarse and middle + fine fraction of clay - added together to clay (T)
- `S+U+T`: all portions of grain sizes together (theoretically 100%)
- `Bodenart`: soil type according to Kartieranleitung 5 (sand, silt, clay)

## What to do
### 1. The data needs some cleanup
  - the column KAKpot2 is not needed
  - the header displays numbers which do not make much sense. Also, there is a second header with the units of the data. Both is not needed. Instead, the header should display the column names without the numbers but with the unit integrated such like this: Tiefe_[cm] 
  - there is a typo in the column "Expozition". It should actually be "Exposition"
  - 99999 and 99999,99 are the NA values, but R does not know this, so all these values need to be set to NA
  - two columns need to be calculated: base_saturation_[%] by dividing "Kationen" by "KAKpot" and SOM_[%] by multiplying Corg with 1,72
  
### 2. Visualisation
  - I would like to aggregate the columns Ca, Mg, K, Na and Kationen by profile number and visualize them with a grouped or stacked barplot like this https://r-graph-gallery.com/48-grouped-barplot-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/thecode4-1.png
  - then I would like to have 3 piecharts of the "Ah" horizons of the profiles 82, 111 and 134 next to each other where I can see the portion of S (Sand), U (silt) and T (clay). See below:
  ![Sketch of piechart](/Projects/timow98/sketch_1.jpg)
  - I would like to know where the profiles are - maybe they can be visualized on a simple map using the coordinates of the respective columns?

I would like a violin plot with a mean for all 13 scales plus the three factors.
