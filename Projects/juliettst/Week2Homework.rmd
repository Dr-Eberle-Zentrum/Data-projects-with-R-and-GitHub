# Reproduce this super nice chart!

It is often that you find a chart that you really like but have no idea how to do. An example might be the following one (click image to enlarge):

[![](https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png)](https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png)

Which is shown and detailed on [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).

The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible **using** `ggplot` and the data available in the provided CSV file.

## **Goal of the project**

The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible using `ggplot` and the data available in the provided [CSV file](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv) with the following content (first lines):

```{r}

csv_url <- "https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv"
data <- read_csv(csv_url)

datatable(head(data, 5))


```

### **Visualization priorities (from high to low)**

-   line style with animal name labels

-   percent labels at line ends

-   time range label at line start

-   x-axis marks

-   arrow line style

-   annotation of brown bear

-   text coloring

-   relative font sizes

-   animal symbol for brown bear [![](https://dr-eberle-zentrum.github.io/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/Projects/martin-raden/icons8-bear-67.png){alt=""}](https://dr-eberle-zentrum.github.io/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/Projects/martin-raden/icons8-bear-67.png)

Let’s see how close you can get! As a starting point, you might want to have a look at [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/).

Looking forward to see your solutions!

Best, Martin
