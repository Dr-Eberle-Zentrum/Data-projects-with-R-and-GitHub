# Theory

**BIG5 personality dimensions**

The BIG5 model of personality is the most common psychological theory describing personality of human beings.
The model includes five dimensions of personality:

- Openness
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

For keeping the dimensions in mind you can think of their first letters which build the word OCEAN.

# Data

**Data-set**

It is a open data-set from this source: http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/. Beside the variables that describe the BIG5 personality dimensions
there are more variables like age, country or gender. The codebook contains a full overview about the data frame and its variables.The countries are 
coded with the ISO country code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes#UNI2)

**Data preparation**

To prepare data for visualization, please:

- code missing values with NA
- exclude all values of countries, which are not part of our investigation
- calculate the mean of each personality dimension (10 items) and safe it in a new variable

# Visualization

**Visualization goals**

Using ggplot2 and the csv-file, our visualization should contain:

- x-axis: countries: United States, Great Britain, India, Australia and  Brazil *[Country]*
- y-axis: score in personality dimensions *[Mean]*
- groups: BIG5 personality dimensions 
- coloring of the bars
- explanation of the colors right beside the chart
