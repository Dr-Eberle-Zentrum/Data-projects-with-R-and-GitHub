## Horizontal OCEAN Plot

I didnt really like it, so i didnt include it to the final grid.

## Final Graph

After long perfection of the plots, the grid stopped working :\_)

    grid_plot <-
    plot_grid(p_dodged_bars, p_letter) +
      labs(caption = "The following items were rated on a five point scale where 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree, 0=missed")

    add_sub(grid_plot,
            "This data was collected through on interactive online personality test.
    O : openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
    C : conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
    E : extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
    A : agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
    N : neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)",
            x = 0, hjust = 0, size = 10) %>%
      ggdraw()
