# The Economic Impact of Remote Work on Urban Housing Markets

In this project, we’ll analyze housing prices and remote work. With the
recent surge in remote work, especially due to the pandemic, we’re
curious to see how this trend has impacted urban housing markets over
the years.

## Introduction to the Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is from the Harvard Dataverse and
contains information on housing prices and several other relevant
variables across different countries. The variables included in the
dataset are as follows:

-   **Percentage of Workforce Working Remotely**
-   **Average Urban Housing Price Index**
-   **Urban Population Growth Rate (%)**
-   **Rural Population Growth Rate (%)**
-   **Public Transport Ridership Change (%)**
-   **Internet Infrastructure Investment (Million USD)**
-   **Environmental Impact Score (1-100)**

## Data Manipulation Goals

The primary goal of data manipulation in this project is to prepare the
dataset for analysis. This involves sorting the data, identifying and
handling missing values, and ensuring that the dataset is in a suitable
format for visualization and analysis.

## Visualization Goals

The main visualization goal is to create a scatterplot that illustrates
the relationship between housing prices and the percentage of the
workforce working remotely in different countries. This visualization
will help us understand if there is any discernible correlation between
remote work trends and urban housing market dynamics.
