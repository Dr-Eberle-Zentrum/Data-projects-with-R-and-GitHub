## R Markdown

This is my attempt for a solution for Jan's project. 

```{r data, warning=FALSE}
# read in dataset
food_data <- read.csv("/Users/sarahlober/Data Projects with R and GitHub/Projects/jan-thiele7/data_openfood.csv")
head(food_data)
```
I did not quite grasp the categorization variables as the head does not tell me much about them, so I'm doing some more exploration.

```{r variables, warning=FALSE}
table(food_data$pnns_groups_1)
table(food_data$pnns_groups_2)
```

## Plotting the data

I'm getting the data ready for plotting first, then create the actual plot.

```{r plot data, warning=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r plot nutriscore, warning=FALSE}

```
