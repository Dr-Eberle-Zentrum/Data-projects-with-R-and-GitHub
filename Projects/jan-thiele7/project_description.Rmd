title: "Exploring Nutritional Value and Environmental Impact of Food Products Sold in Germany"

A while back I did a data class where we had to do a project on any dataset we wanted. Our group decided on the Openfoodfacts data set. We were interested in the relationship between nutritional value and environmental impact of food products sold in Germany. We did the project in Python and now I would like to know how it would like in R. 

### About the Data set
Openfoodfacts is an app and website where users can look up any information about food products either by scanning the bar code or searching for it manually. 

The information users can look up include e.g production places, nutritional information like fat, sugar, protein per 100g and front-package labels such as the Nutriscore, Ecoscore and NOVA groups.

The data on the website is crowdsourced, meaning users can enter information about food products on their own. This results in a lot of missing and therefore messy data.   

There are two options to download the dataset.

1. Downloading the whole data set. 

It is quite huge which could make computations difficult. But if you know ways of dealing with huge data sets in R feel free to download the whole dataset from the [Openfoodfacts Website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data).

2. Downloading a subset of the data

Using the [advanced search form](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl) you can download a subset of the data by specifying a criterion like **countries = Germany** to get all the products sold in Germany. 

 

### Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between nutritional value and environmental impact of different food groups sold within germany. Particularly we are interested in discovering foods which are both healthy and environmentally friendly.

Both factors are summarised as the Nutriscore and Ecoscore respectively. They are front-package labels originating from France, which try to communicate health and impact on the environment on a 5 step colored scale.

- A = highly nutritional / low environmental impact
- E = low nutritional value / high environmental impact


## Visualization Goals
In the end I would like to see a bubble plot that shows the relationship between Nutriscore and Ecoscore divided by categories. Here you can see an example.

#### Visualization priorities (from high to low)
- Ecoscore on the x axis
- Nutriscore on the y axis 
- adjusting size of the bubble by deviation within one category(e.g. if there is high variance between nutri- and ecoscore within a category then the bubble should be bigger)
- coloring of the bubbles with the colors of the nutriscore and ecoscore colors (e.g. if something has nutriscore of B and an ecoscore of B then it is colored green. Pay attention to the in between cases (e.g Nutriscore B and Ecoscore D), maybe you can find a clever way of deciding on their color.)

**Note:**
The data set contains several categorization variables. 
The plot above uses the *pnns_groups_1* and *pnns_groups_2* from the full data set. The same variables are called *off:food_groups* and *off:food_groups_tags* in the subset data set.
