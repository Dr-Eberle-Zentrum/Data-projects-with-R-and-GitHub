## General project topic

Companies often discover unique patterns when organizing and visualizing
consumer data. This project aims to visualize shopping trends of
American consumers by age group and gender, focusing on their Purchase
Amount and Frequency of Purchases. You need to create four separate
graphs:

1.  Female consumers’ purchase amount by age group,
2.  Male consumers’ purchase amount by age group,
3.  Female consumers’ frequency of purchases by age group,
4.  Male consumers’ frequency of purchases by age group.

## The Data Set (manipulated)

    ##   Customer.ID Age Gender Purchase.Amount..USD. Frequency.of.Purchases
    ## 1           1  55   Male                    53            Fortnightly
    ## 2           2  19   Male                    64            Fortnightly
    ## 3           3  50   Male                    73                 Weekly
    ## 4           4  21   Male                    90                 Weekly
    ## 5           5  45   Male                    49               Annually
    ## 6           6  46   Male                    20                 Weekly
