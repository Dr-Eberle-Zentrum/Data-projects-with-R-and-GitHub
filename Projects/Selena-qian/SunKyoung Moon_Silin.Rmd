# Introduction

The report analyzes foreign language proficiency across selected European countries (Germany, France, Sweden, and Austria) and compares their performance to the EU average. The primary goal is to evaluate differences in proficiency levels by the number of foreign languages known among adults aged 18 to 69.

# Analysis

The dataset is filtered to include data from 2022 for the relevant countries and age group. Key steps include below

1) Renaming and reorganizing columns for clarity.

2) Calculating the difference between each country's proficiency percentage and the EU average for the same category (number of foreign languages known).

3) Grouping data by country and number of languages for summary statistics, particularly focusing on the mean differences from the EU average.

The results are visualized using a bar chart, where red and blue indicate whether a country's proficiency level is above or below the EU average.

# My Challenge

One of the main challenges was incorporating country flags and the EU flag into the facet labels for enhanced visual clarity.

This was achieved using the ggtext library, which supports HTML rendering in ggplot facet labels. Flags were added as <img> tags in the facet labels, with specific sizes and alignments. The element_markdown() function in theme() allowed rendering these HTML elements correctly.

# Result
The final plot effectively illustrates the proficiency levels of each country compared to the EU average, with flags for each country and the EU flag enhancing the visualization. You can see my code and Result image below
