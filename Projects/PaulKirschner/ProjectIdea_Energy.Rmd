# Power Plants in Germany

Nowadays the focus in energy production is on renewable energies e.g. solar or wind. Those renewable energies can be sourced on a very small scale, but historically energy production in Germany is centralized in big power plants. Over the years, different kind of power plants from coal to natural gas to nuclear have been created in an effort to satisfy the ever growing appetite for more and more energy.

## Goal of the project

The idea of this project is to explore the current energy production in large power plants (\> 100 MW) in Germany. There are regional differences, differences in the sizes of the plants depending on the energy source and also different historic development phases / ages.

The data set is made available by the national environmental agency: ![UBA](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/dokument/datenbank-kraftwerke-in-deutschland)

and can be downloaded as a .xls file directly here: ![DATA](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/372/dokumente/kraftwerke_de_ab_100_mw_0.xls)

The first task is to create a tidy .csv data table, which should look something like the following.

## Data Table - Power Plants in Germany over 100 MW in the year 2022

| Kraftwerksname             | Betreiber                                           | Bundesland | Standort-PLZ | Kraftwerksstandort | Elektrische Bruttoleistung (MW) | Fernw채rme-leistung (MW) | Inbetriebnahme (ggf. Ert체chtigung) | Anlagenart | Prim채renergietr채ger |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|

| Altbach/Deizisau GT A-C, E | EnBW Kraftwerke AG                                  | BW         | 73776        | Altbach            | 305,0                           |                         | 1971-1997                          | GT         | Erdgas              |
| Altbach/Deizisau HKW 1     | EnBW Kraftwerke AG                                  | BW         | 73776        | Altbach            | 476,0                           | 280,0                   | 1985 (2006)                        | HKW        | Steinkohle          |

## Visualisazion ideas

-   Identify historic eras for energy sources (coal, water, renewable)
-   Which energy source is the most centralized / which one is geographically decentralized?
-   Group the energy sources by renewable vs. fossil types and analyze them regarding size or Bundesland
-   Challenge: Create a map in R (you will need more packages) and color the Bundeslaender by percentage of total renewable energy production in large power plants (\> 100 MW)

Looking forward to see your solutions!

Best, Paul!
