# Revised Solution to Miguel's Project by Meri
```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
```
### Background

# Finite Element Analysis

- used to predict stresses/ deformations on structures under defined conditions
- reduction of 3D model to **finite** number of **elements**

![Finite Elements Analysis representing stress on a Jaw bone](./bilder/mesh.png)

### 1. Iterative import of datasets:

I import the data sets into a list by iteration of the respective url to use. As the data is imported into a list first, I transformed that list into a data frame, that is easier to work with, using `bind_rows`.

```{r ImportDataFromGitHub, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
animals <- c("bear", "hyaena", "lion", "wolf")

# Importing the four dataset as entries to the list `smoothstress`
smoothstress <- list()
for (i in animals) {
  url <- paste0("https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/raw/main/Projects/MiguelDLM/smooth_stress_tensor%20(",i,").csv")
  smoothstress[[i]] <- read_csv(url)
}

# Combining listentries into a dataframe by animal
smoothstress_animals <- bind_rows(smoothstress, .id = "animal")
```

## 2. Resclaing the coordinates per dimension onto a scale from 0 to 1:

The goal is to compare the stress on the jaws of our different animals, relative along the dimension of their jaw. To do so, the data has to be rescaled in two steps:

1. rescaling the values onto a scale from 0 to 1
2. cutting the rescaled values into 10 "slices"

Both of these steps have to be performed **per animal and dimension** within the same data frame.

![Rescaling Example](./dimension_example.png)

Here I am using the `across` function to perform the same actions (rescaling values to new scale from 0 to 10 with `scales::rescale` and assigning the intervals in which the entries fall based on that with `cut`) for all three dimensions in one command to avoide copy and pasting.

```{r RescalingCoordinates}

#Rescaling the coordinates and creating breaks
smoothstress_animals <- smoothstress_animals %>% 
  group_by(animal) %>% 
  mutate(across(
    .col = c("X","Y","Z"), # I tried running dimensions = c(X","Y","Z") ... .col = dimensions, but it did not work like that.
    {~ scales::rescale(.x,to = c(0,1))},
    .names = "{.col}_range"
  )) %>% 
  mutate(across(
    .col = c("X_range", "Y_range", "Z_range"),
    {~ cut(.x, (0:10)/10)},
      .names = "{.col}_breaks"
  )) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
```

## 3. Calculating Mean Von Misses Stress per interval

Finally, in order to not plot a bunch of point per intervall, I am taking the Mean of all values in that interval.

```{r CalculatingMeanStressPerDimension, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
range_names <- c("X_range_breaks","Y_range_breaks","Z_range_breaks")

for (i in range_names){
  .data <- smoothstress_animals %>%
    group_by(across(all_of(i)), animal) %>%
    summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`),
              SDStress = sd(`Von Misses Stress`)) %>%
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(MockDimension = i)
  if (exists("smoothstress_ranges")){
    smoothstress_ranges <- bind_rows(smoothstress_ranges, .data)
  } else {
    smoothstress_ranges <- .data
  }
}

# Creating "easier" columns to work with for range and MockDimension
range_map <- c("(0,0.1]" = 0.1, 
               "(0.1,0.2]" = 0.2, 
               "(0.2,0.3]" = 0.3,
               "(0.3,0.4]" = 0.4, 
               "(0.4,0.5]" = 0.5, 
               "(0.5,0.6]" = 0.6,
               "(0.6,0.7]" = 0.7, 
               "(0.7,0.8]" = 0.8, 
               "(0.8,0.9]" = 0.9,
               "(0.9,1]" = 1.0)
dimension_map <- c("X_range_breaks" = "X", "Y_range_breaks" = "Y", "Z_range_breaks" = "Z")

smoothstress_ranges <- smoothstress_ranges %>% 
  mutate(range = coalesce(X_range_breaks, Y_range_breaks, Z_range_breaks)) %>%
  mutate(RelativeCoordinate = range_map[range]) %>% 
  mutate(Dimension = dimension_map[MockDimension]) %>% 
  select(animal, Dimension, RelativeCoordinate, MeanStress, SDStress) %>% 
  drop_na()

```

## 4. Visualization of Data

```{r Visualization, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(smoothstress_ranges, aes(x=RelativeCoordinate, y = MeanStress, color = animal))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_classic()+
  xlab("Relative Coordinate")+
  ylab("Mean von Misses Stress")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "bear" = "brown",
    "hyaena" = "#E15634",
    "lion" ="#FFBF46",
    "wolf" = "grey"))+
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Dimension))
```

Also just to represent a bit all of the point averaged I am adding a `geom_ribbon` of the Standard Deviation.

```{r VisualizationPlusSD, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(smoothstress_ranges, aes(x=RelativeCoordinate, y = MeanStress, color = animal))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = MeanStress - SDStress, ymax = MeanStress + SDStress, fill = animal),
              alpha = 0.2, colour = NA)+
  theme_classic()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  xlab("Relative Coordinate")+
  ylab("Mean von Misses Stress")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "bear" = "brown",
    "hyaena" = "#E15634",
    "lion" ="#FFBF46",
    "wolf" = "grey"))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "bear" = "brown",
    "hyaena" = "#E15634",
    "lion" ="#FFBF46",
    "wolf" = "grey"))+
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Dimension))
```

So what are my amateur conclusions?

1. Lion and wolf display very similar profiles.
2. Bear deviates slightly from lion and wolf.
3. Hyaenas are stressed.

Is this correlated with phylogeny of species?

![Phylogeny of Carnivora](./Carnivora_phylogeny.png)
Not really.

## Archived Old Solution:

Importing the datasets:
```{r DataImport}
# smoothstress_bear <- read_csv("https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/raw/main/Projects/MiguelDLM/smooth_stress_tensor%20(bear).csv")
# smoothstress_lion <- read_csv("https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/raw/main/Projects/MiguelDLM/smooth_stress_tensor%20(lion).csv")
# smoothstress_wolf <- read_csv("https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/raw/main/Projects/MiguelDLM/smooth_stress_tensor%20(wolf).csv")
# smoothstress_hyaena <- read_csv("https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/raw/main/Projects/MiguelDLM/smooth_stress_tensor%20(hyaena).csv")
```

Next I created the relative intervals across the length of the respective axises. (For the data wrangling steps I should probably write functions (which I am not super comfortable with) so for now, this also works).

```{r IntervalCreation}
# bear_xbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_bear$X), max(smoothstress_bear$X), length.out = 11))
# bear_ybreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_bear$Y), max(smoothstress_bear$Y), length.out = 11))
# bear_zbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_bear$Z), max(smoothstress_bear$Z), length.out = 11))
# 
# lion_xbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_lion$X), max(smoothstress_lion$X), length.out = 11))
# lion_ybreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_lion$Y), max(smoothstress_lion$Y), length.out = 11))
# lion_zbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_lion$Z), max(smoothstress_lion$Z), length.out = 11))
# 
# wolf_xbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_wolf$X), max(smoothstress_wolf$X), length.out = 11))
# wolf_ybreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_wolf$Y), max(smoothstress_wolf$Y), length.out = 11))
# wolf_zbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_wolf$Z), max(smoothstress_wolf$Z), length.out = 11))
# 
# hyaena_xbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_hyaena$X), max(smoothstress_hyaena$X), length.out = 11))
# hyaena_ybreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_hyaena$Y), max(smoothstress_hyaena$Y), length.out = 11))
# hyaena_zbreaks <- c(seq(min(smoothstress_hyaena$Z), max(smoothstress_hyaena$Z), length.out = 11))
```

Next I am calculating the mean Stress across the intervalls.
```{r MeanStress}
# bear_x <- smoothstress_bear %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(X, bear_xbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# bear_y <- smoothstress_bear %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Y, bear_ybreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# bear_z <- smoothstress_bear %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Z, bear_zbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# 
# lion_x <- smoothstress_lion %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(X, lion_xbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# lion_y <- smoothstress_lion %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Y, lion_ybreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# lion_z <- smoothstress_lion %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Z, lion_zbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# 
# wolf_x <- smoothstress_wolf %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(X, wolf_xbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# wolf_y <- smoothstress_wolf %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Y, wolf_ybreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# wolf_z <- smoothstress_wolf %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Z, wolf_zbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# 
# hyaena_x <- smoothstress_hyaena %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(X, hyaena_xbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# hyaena_y <- smoothstress_hyaena %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Y, hyaena_ybreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
# hyaena_z <- smoothstress_hyaena %>% 
#   mutate(breaks = cut(Z, hyaena_zbreaks)) %>% 
#   group_by(breaks) %>% 
#   summarise(MeanStress = mean(`Von Misses Stress`))
```

Here I am combining the data of the different animals per dimension into one dataframe.
```{r DimensionDataframes}
# x_stress <- data.frame(RelativeCoordinate = c(0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1),
#                        stress_bear = bear_x$MeanStress,
#                        stress_lion = lion_x$MeanStress,
#                        stress_wolf = wolf_x$MeanStress,
#                        stress_hyaena = hyaena_x$MeanStress)
# x_stress_long <- x_stress %>% 
#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("stress_"),
#                names_to = "animal",
#                values_to = "MeanStress") %>% 
#   mutate(animal = str_replace(animal, "stress_",""))
# 
# y_stress <- data.frame(RelativeCoordinate = c(0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1),
#                        stress_bear = bear_y$MeanStress,
#                        stress_lion = lion_y$MeanStress,
#                        stress_wolf = wolf_y$MeanStress,
#                        stress_hyaena = hyaena_y$MeanStress)
# y_stress_long <- y_stress %>% 
#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("stress_"),
#                names_to = "animal",
#                values_to = "MeanStress") %>% 
#   mutate(animal = str_replace(animal, "stress_",""))
# 
# z_stress <- data.frame(RelativeCoordinate = c(0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1),
#                        stress_bear = bear_z$MeanStress,
#                        stress_lion = lion_z$MeanStress,
#                        stress_wolf = wolf_z$MeanStress,
#                        stress_hyaena = hyaena_z$MeanStress)
# z_stress_long <- z_stress %>% 
#   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("stress_"),
#                names_to = "animal",
#                values_to = "MeanStress") %>% 
#   mutate(animal = str_replace(animal, "stress_",""))
```

This was my first attempt at plotting, but the `facet_grid` works much better.

```{r GridPlotting}
# px <- ggplot(x_stress_long, aes(x=RelativeCoordinate, y = MeanStress, color = animal))+
#   geom_point()+
#   geom_line()+
#   theme_classic()+
#   xlab("Relative Coordinate")+
#   ylab("Mean van Misses Stress")+
#   scale_color_manual(values = c(
#     "bear" = "brown",
#     "hyaena" = "#E15634",
#     "lion" ="#FFBF46",
#     "wolf" = "grey"),
#   guide ="none")
# 
# py <- ggplot(y_stress_long, aes(x=RelativeCoordinate, y = MeanStress, color = animal))+
#   geom_point()+
#   geom_line()+
#   theme_classic()+
#   xlab("Relative Coordinate")+
#   ylab("Mean van Misses Stress")+
#   scale_color_manual(values = c(
#     "bear" = "brown",
#     "hyaena" = "#E15634",
#     "lion" ="#FFBF46",
#     "wolf" = "grey"),
#   guide ="none")
# 
# pz <- ggplot(z_stress_long, aes(x=RelativeCoordinate, y = MeanStress, color = animal))+
#   geom_point()+
#   geom_line()+
#   theme_classic()+
#   xlab("Relative Coordinate")+
#   ylab("Mean van Misses Stress")+
#   scale_color_manual(values = c(
#     "bear" = "brown",
#     "hyaena" = "#E15634",
#     "lion" ="#FFBF46",
#     "wolf" = "grey"))
# 
# grid.arrange(px, py, pz, nrow = 1)
#   
```

To plot using `facet_grid` I combine all dimensions into one dataframe.

```{r FacetPlotting}
# x_stress_long$Dimension <- "X"
# y_stress_long$Dimension <- "Y"
# z_stress_long$Dimension <- "Z"
# df_list <- list(x_stress_long, y_stress_long, z_stress_long)
# 
# stress_long <- Reduce(function(x,y) merge(x,y, all = TRUE), df_list, accumulate = FALSE)
# 
# p <- ggplot(stress_long, aes(x=RelativeCoordinate, y = MeanStress, color = animal))+
#   geom_point()+
#   geom_line()+
#   theme_classic()+
#   xlab("Relative Coordinate")+
#   ylab("Mean van Misses Stress")+
#   scale_color_manual(values = c(
#     "bear" = "brown",
#     "hyaena" = "#E15634",
#     "lion" ="#FFBF46",
#     "wolf" = "grey"))
# 
# p+facet_grid(cols = vars(Dimension))
```
