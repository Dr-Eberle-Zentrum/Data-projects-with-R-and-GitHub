```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
smoothstress <- read_csv("https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/raw/main/Projects/MiguelDLM/smooth_stress_tensor.csv")
```
So when I read this file, I cannot find different 3D models. Is this something defined by the nodes?

## Visualizing data set for understanding

```{r}
smoothstress %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = X, y =`Von Misses Stress`))+
  geom_line(color = "red")+
  theme_classic()

```

```{r}
smoothstress %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Y, y =`Von Misses Stress`))+
  geom_line(color = "red")+
  theme_classic()

```

```{r}
smoothstress %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Z, y =`Von Misses Stress`))+
  geom_line(color = "red")+
  theme_classic()

```

Since the force distribution of the von misses stresses along the axises resembles a relief, I presume this is where the sampleing comes into play?
