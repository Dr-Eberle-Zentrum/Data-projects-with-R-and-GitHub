abstract = {Finite element analysis (FEA) is a technique that reconstructs stress, strain, and deformation in a digital structure. Although common-place in engineering and orthopedic science for more than 30 years, only recently has it begun to be adopted in the zoological and paleontological sciences to address questions of organismal morphology, function, and evolution. Current research tends to focus on either deductive studies that assume a close relationship between form and function or inductive studies that aim to test this relationship, although explicit hypothesis-testing bridges these two standpoints. Validation studies have shown congruence between in vivo or in vitro strain and FE-inferred strain. Future validation work on a broad range of taxa will assist in phylogenetically bracketing our extinct animal FE-models to increase confidence in our input parameters, although currently, FEA has much potential in addressing questions of form-function relationships, providing appropriate questions are asked of the existing data.

abstract = {Finite element analysis (FEA) is a computational method used to predict the behaviour (stresses, strains and deformation) of a structure under predefined loading conditions. It can be applied to different biological structures, such as bone, to study defined muscle-driven scenarios. However, as muscle is an extremely complex structure to model, evolutionary biologists usually model muscle forces indirectly. In 2007, the BONELOAD MATLAB routine was developed to distribute muscle forces on a surface defined by the user. This routine then had to be coupled with a pre-existing FEA software (e.g. Strand7) to perform the analyses and has been widely used ever since. In this manuscript, we present a new method to run muscle-driven finite element simulations on a bone by distributing muscle forces on their insertions area, all within a single environment. We apply this protocol in three different situations: two biting simulations (unilateral and bilateral) and a shoulder flexion simulation. We demonstrate how to prepare the mesh, delineate the muscle origins and insertions, define the constraints, adjust material properties, choose a loading scenario (uniform, tangential or tangential-plus-normal), and extract the results. Our automated script meshes the 3D model, defines the constraints and distributes muscle forces within a single simulation software: ‘Metafor' (nonlinear solver, owned and distributed by Gesval S.A) or ‘Fossils' (a new open-source linear static solver developed in the frame of this work). ‘Metafor' and ‘Fossils' can perform the entire protocol (from the meshing to the muscle-induced simulations) on high-resolution volumetric meshes (millions of tetrahedra) and rapidly, exceeding the processing time of other widely used software protocols by up to four times. We demonstrate that the results obtained from our protocol are highly congruent with brands such as Strand7. Thus, our protocol opens up the possibility to routinely and rapidly simulate the behaviour of high-precision muscle-driven FE models containing millions of tetrahedra.},

abstract = {In this work we present a reverse engineering study geometrical reconstruction of an amphibian skull. For the first time, the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is analysed to be suitable for simulation in a FEA Package. The feeding behaviour is tested reproducing the in vivo conditions to understand the functional morphology and the feeding ecology of this amphibian. For the geometry reconstruction, a smooth and delete procedure should be done to avoid the rough geometry generated in the image segmentation because this roughness could generate a lot of singularities in the geometry causing artificial noise in the stress results. {\textcopyright} Civil-Comp Press, 2011.},
