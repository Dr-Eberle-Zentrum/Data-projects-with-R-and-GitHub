# Crops vs. Climate

Climate change is a huge challenge for farmers worldwide. It is causing
extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, which can have
devastating effects on crops and livestock. This project focuses on
**crop production in the region of Tübingen and how it has been affected
by climate change**.

## Data Sets

### Crop Production Data

**Source**: [Duden et al. (2023). *Crop yields and area in Germany from
1979 to 2021 at a harmonized
district-level.*](https://doi.org/10.3220/DATA20231117103252-0)

The accompanying documentation
([PDF](https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00056476/Readme.pdf))
offers a thorough explanation of the dataset’s structure, including
column descriptions, units of measurement, and crop classifications. The
dataset itself is available as a [CSV
file](https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00056476/Final_data.csv).

**Description**: This dataset contains information on crop yields and
area in Germany from 1979 to 2021 at a harmonized district-level. It
includes data on various crops, such as wheat, barley, and maize,
including their yield (in tons per hectare) and the harvested area (in
hectares). We are interested in the crop yields in the district of
Tübingen.

### Climate Data

**Source**: [Deutscher Wetterdienst
(2023)](https://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/cdc/cdc_ueberblick-klimadaten_en.html)

**Description**: The Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) provides a wide range
of annual climate data, covering key variables such as mean air
temperature, precipitation, and frost days. These datasets are found
under category 4: *Average values for the individual federal states and
for Germany as a whole*, specifically within the *“annual”* directory:

The datasets are provided as text files (.txt) within their respective
directories. Users can download them easily by right-clicking and
selecting “Save link as…”

The data is organized in table format, where each row corresponds to a
year and each column represents the value of a specific climate variable
(e.g., mean air temperature) for each federal state of Germany. Detailed
information about each variable, including units of measurement, is
available in the accompanying documentation within the respective
directory.

For our analysis, we focus on the climate data specifically for the
federal state of Baden-Württemberg.

## Data Manipulation Goals

-   **Select crop yield data:** extract the annual yield data of *spring
    barley*, *grain maize* and *winter wheat* for Tübingen (nuts\_id =
    DE142).
-   **Select climate data:** extract the annual climate data for the
    variables *mean air temperature*, *precipitation* and *ice days* for
    Baden-Württemberg.
-   **Merge the datasets:** create a tidy tibble (each row is one
    observation).

## Visualization Goals

We want to investigate potential correlations between the crop yields
and climate variables. The goal is to visualize how changes in climate
variables such as mean air temperature, precipitation, and frost days
may have influenced crop yields over the years. The tasks are arranged
from highest to lowest priority, top to bottom.

**Plot the crop yields against the climate variable:**

Firstly, we want to explore the relationship between crop yields and
specific climate variables to identify any potential correlations.

-   Use
    [faceting](https://r-graph-gallery.com/223-faceting-with-ggplot2.html)
    to create separate plots for each climate variable, arranged in
    vertical panels.
-   Create scatter plots with the **yields** (t/ha) of the three crops
    on the y-axis and the respective **climate variable** on the x-axis.
-   Include **regression lines** for each crop to show a trend.
-   Add titles to each plot indicating the climate variable being
    analyzed.
-   Color the points and regression lines by crop type.
-   Include labels for the axes, including the units of measurement.
-   Add a legend to indicate the crop type.
-   Can you see any correlations between crop yields and the climate
    variables? Do the crops respond differently to changes in the
    climate variables? Are some crops more sensitive or better adapted
    to particular extreme conditions?

**Create time plots of crop yields and climate variables:**

Next, we want to visualize potential correlations between crop yields
and climate variables over time.

-   Use faceting again to create separate timeline scatter plots for
    each variable: one for each **climate variable** and one for the
    **yield** of each crop type, arranged in vertical panels.
-   For each panel, plot the **years** on the x-axis and the respective
    **climate variable** or **crop yield** on the y-axis.
-   Standardize the y-axis of each plot using the scale() function.
-   Connect the scatter points with smooth, curved lines.
-   Color the lines and dots green for positive values (above average)
    and orange for negative values (below average).
-   Add titles and axis labels to each plot.
-   Do you notice any patterns or correlations over time between climate
    variable and crop yield fluctuations? Do the crops behave
    differently in response to changes in the climate variables? Are the
    findings consistent with the first visualization?
