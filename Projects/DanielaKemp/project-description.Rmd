The given data is a subset of the data containing 25 000 rows.

The data table is pretty sparse, in a lot of rows column data is missing. For any analysis you'd have to explain which subset of the data you used, and how you got this subset. Using a subset of the table with only the relevant rows is advised.

·         Define a subset of the table without any Nestle products or products using palm oil.

·         Delete all rows where the sum of all sugars is greater than the amount of carbohydrates

·         Use kj/100g to fill out the blanks in kcal/100g and vice versa.

·         Group foods depending on type (pnns_groups_1), and find the average nutriscore for each group. Visualize this in a suitable plot, using the nutri-score colors if applicable.

·         The nutri-score was established in 2016 in France. Using different indicators (like kj/100g, portion size, additives), can you see a difference in the 'healthyness" difference in food quality between 2016 and 2021(Germany voluntarily adopts the nutri-score) in France and Germany?

·         Look at additives in the food and try to find correlations between foodgroups and additives.

·         Try to find a method to classify (define classes yourself) the foods for CO2-usage (carbon foodprint 100g), and use this method to classify the food items from each unique countrie with the highest/lowest/median energy-kcal_100g

·         Visualize the exports of every country with a sufficiently large number of different exports by food type

·         Visualize whatever you find most interesting here
