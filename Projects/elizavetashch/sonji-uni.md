# Preparation

    library(tidyverse)

    datRaw <- read.csv2('Microplastic_Affect_Soil_Properties_and_Plant_Biomass.csv', encoding = 'UTF-8') |> 
      rename(shape = X.U.FEFF.shape)

    datRaw <- read_csv2('Microplastic_Affect_Soil_Properties_and_Plant_Biomass.csv')

# Data Processing

> *Note:* The variable `root` is corrupt, in the sense that it contains
> a date as well as numbers. Dates have to be excluded.

    dat <- datRaw |> 
      # convert
      mutate(across(c(concentration, root, CO2),
                    as.double)) |> 
      # filter polyethylene films and concentrations and remove dates
      filter(shape == 'Films',
             str_detect(root, '\\d$')) |> 
      # generate total biomass
      mutate(root = as.double(root),
             biomass = root + shoot) |> 
      # recode soil aggregation
      mutate(WSA = WSA / 1000) |> 
      # select columns
      select(concentration,
             CO2,
             WSA,

      # drop NAs
