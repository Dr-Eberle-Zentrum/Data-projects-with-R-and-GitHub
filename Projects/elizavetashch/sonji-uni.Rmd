2. [Filter polyethylene films]    
3. [Generate total biomass]

# Preparation

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
datRaw <- read.csv2('Microplastic_Affect_Soil_Properties_and_Plant_Biomass.csv', encoding = 'UTF-8') |> 
  rename(shape = X.U.FEFF.shape)
```

# Data Processing 

## Filter polyethylene films

```{r}
dat <- datRaw |> 
  filter(shape == 'Films')
```

## Generate total biomass

The variable `root` is corrupt, in the sense that it contains a date as well as numbers. Dates have to be excluded.

```{r}
dat <- dat |> 
  filter(str_detect(root, '\\d$'))
```

```{r}
options(digits = 5)

dat <- dat |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(shoot = as.numeric(shoot),
         root = as.double(root),
         biomass = root / shoot) |> 
  ungroup()
```

# Plot

```{r fig-rootShootRatio, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between root and shoot, colored with the value of biomass"}
library(latticeExtra)
library(grid)

levelplot(biomass ~ shoot * root, 
          dat, 
          panel = panel.levelplot.points, 
          scales = list(x = list(at = seq(0, 400, by = 50)))) + 
  layer_(panel.2dsmoother(..., n = 200))
```
