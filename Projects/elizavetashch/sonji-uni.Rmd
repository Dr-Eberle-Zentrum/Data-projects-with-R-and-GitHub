# Preparation

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
datRaw <- read.csv2('Microplastic_Affect_Soil_Properties_and_Plant_Biomass.csv', encoding = 'UTF-8') |> 
  rename(shape = X.U.FEFF.shape)
```

# Filter polyethylene films

```{r}
dat <- datRaw |> 
  filter(shape == 'Films')
```

# Generate total biomass

```{r}
options(digits = 6)

dat <- dat |> 
  mutate(shoot = as.numeric(shoot),
         root = as.double(root),
         totalBiomass = sum(shoot, root, na.rm = T))
```

The variable `root` is corrupt, in the sense that it contains a date as well as numbers.
