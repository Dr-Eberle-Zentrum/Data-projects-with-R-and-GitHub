## Annotation
In this project I want to prepare templates for my upcoming bachelor thesis it includes: 
1. preparing a dummy data set for the parameters I am testing in my experiment (since I dont have any data yet)
2. preparing graph templates to visualize my expectations of the results or my hypothesis 

## Introduciton 
Microplastic and Heavy Metals are two strong pollutors in agricultural areas. In my bachelor thesis I want to look into their interaction and represent the effects the produce on two different plant species separately and via interacting. 

## Data Set 
Since I do not have a data set yet I will create one filled with dummy data the way I expect the plants to perform. Though the data set is not existing now, its structure is already determined. 

**Parameter**  | **Description**
------------- | -------------
pot_number  | Number of the plant pot 
mp_soil  | Amount of microplastic contamination. Needs to be a _factor_, cause represents a treatment group with three levels of contamination.
hm_soil  | Amount of heavy metal contamination. Needs to be a _factor_, cause represents a treatment group with three levels of contamination.
species  | Will be a _factor_ representing three groups - no plant, a.halleri, a.thaliana
ph_soil  | Soil pH value, measured in the end of the experiment. 
hm_acc  | Amount of heavy metal accumulated by the plant.
dry_biomass  | Dry Biomass of the plant measured in the end of the experiment.
root_shoot  | Root to Shoot ration measured in the end of the experiment. 
abs_cap | Soil absorption capacity measured in the end of the experiment. 
des_cap  | Soil desorption capacity measured in the end of the experiment. 

## Visualization Goals 
From my point of perspective, the following type of graph would be reasonable to build regarding the experiment:
