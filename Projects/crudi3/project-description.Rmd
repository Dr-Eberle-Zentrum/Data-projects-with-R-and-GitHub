## Project description

For the project, I want to use a research question I have previously dealt with in an assignment, but have not done any visualization for. The broad topic is about how Postmaterialism/Materialism (as seen in the data through the Inglehart Index) affects the level of trust towards (governmental) institutions. The data set in question would be the same I used, the [ALLBUS 2021](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA5280).

The [Codebook](https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Advanced-data-processing-with-R/blob/main/Projects/crudi3/Codebook.pdf) and [Data Set](https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Advanced-data-processing-with-R/blob/main/Projects/crudi3/ZA5280_v2-0-0.dta) are uploaded in my project folder.

Theoretically, I am leaning on the cultural backlash hypothesis introduced to populism research, explaining why materialists vote for populist parties more than postmaterialists. The main argument of the hypothesis, is that the erosion and takeover of traditionally materialistic value systems (existential security, the core family, fixed gender roles, etc.) is accompanied by a surge in postmaterialistic values (self-expression, tolerance, multiculturalism, etc.). This swapping of value systems leads to traditional/materialistic people feeling spiteful and misrepresented. Hence the hypothesis, that materialistic people would vote more favorably for populists than postmaterialists. Since populism involves disagreement with the established political culture (the status quo), political trust towards the established system should also be affected by materialistic/postmaterialistic values of individuals. My hypothesis therefore is: If the cultural backlash theory is true, than the degree of post-/materialism influences one's level of political trust. If one scores are high in materialism, then one shows low levels of trust towards institutions. If one has high scores towards postmaterialism, then one shows high levels of trust towards institutions.

The goal of this project is to visualize the average trust levels of different institutions according to their materialistic/postmaterialistic value system. The resulting graph may look similar to this:

Instead of countries, the x-axis should show the institutions the respondents evaluate their trust towards. Colors may be used to allow for easier distinguishing, however colors should primarily be used to be able to see the differences between the groups of post-/materialism. ![](https://www.jingege.wang/bioinformatics/ggplot2/48-grouped-barplot-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/thecode4-1.png) The plot should look somewhat like this, with color coded groups according to their level of post-/materialism.The data set provides everything you need, from trust towards institutions (variable names: pt01-pt20, although there aren't 20 institutions, they are just inconsistently numbered) to the inglehart index (variable name: ingle) for post-/materialism. The documentation of the data set is in German, if that proves to be an issue I will, of course, help with that.

# Visualization goals

-   barplot with every institutional mean trust level --\> this shows how much each institution is being trust in general
-   group the trust levels according to the level of post-/materialism --\> Research Question! Basically, I want you to visualize how much a materialistic person trusts institutions and how much a postmaterialistic person trusts institutions!
-   only one bar per institution, integrate the materialistic/postmaterialistic groups into the bars
-   color code materialistic and postmaterialistic groups universally accross all bars
-   another option is to give each institution a definitve color (health administration - green, pol. parties - blue, etc.) and changing the hue for post-/materialsitic groups (lighter green/lighter blue for materialistic, darker green, darker blue for postmaterialistic etc.)
-   include the average trust level irrespective of post-/materialism as a number within each bar
-   highlight the biggest and smallest difference between the post-/materialistics groups --\> where is the greatest disparity and where is the greatest similarity in trust levels between post-/materialists?

Please let me know, if anything is unclear or wether there are problems with the data. Yours, Christian
