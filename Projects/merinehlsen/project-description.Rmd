# Data Project by Meri

## What is this about?

I have taken all data from a paper from 2011[^1].
This publication focuses on the comparison of two *Drosophila* species, *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Drosophila mojavensis*, aiming to characterize if these two ecologically different species to several dietary composition. While interesting, for this project I'd like you to focus on *D. melanogaster* and how the dietary composition effects survival, developmental time and concentration of biomolecules.

## What is this dataset?
This dataset I generate of this publication includes multiple characteristics for each of the three measurements, namely:
1. dietary composity
2. genetics
3. sex

Lets look at all of them individually in detail.

### 1. dietary composition (hereafter diet)

The publication looks at three different diets, characterized by the respecive amounts of protein (from yeast) and carbohydrates/ sugar (from sucrose) in ratio to each other. They establish them as high protein:sugar ratio (HPS), equal protein:sugar ratio (EPS), and low protein:sugar ratio (LPS), with following percentages of protein and sugar: 

> Our high protein:sugar ratio diet contained 7.1% protein and 17.9% carbohydrate, the EPS diet was 4.3% protein and 21.2% carbohydrate, and the LPS was only 2.5% protein and 24.6% carbohydrate.

If you are interested in the exact weights and volumes used for each diet, you can find those in table 1 of the paper. Importantly though, these three diets are as close in caloric content (=isocaloric) as possible, to ensure, that the observed effects are caused by composition rather than calories. While not perfectly matched (see below), caloric content can be disregarded in the analysis here.

Diet | caloric value (kJ/ 100 g)
-|-
HPS | 452
EPS | 456
LPS | 469

### 2. genetics

To acount for intra-specific variation the authors study 5 genetically different isofemale *D. melanogaster* lines. This is also interesting to this project as genetics can play huge effects in obesity risk etc.

### 3. sex

Lastly both survival and the Metabolic Pools are assesed for specifically for female and male flies. The developmental time on the other hand is determined independent on sex (mainly because the sex of larvae and pupae can not be determined easily by eye).

Now onto the actual measurements of this dataset. Each one of these are compiled in a seperate sheet of the excel table.

### 1. Survival

Survival here is given as the number of adults that eclose from the pupae stage per vial.

#### 2. Deleopmental Time 

As holometabolous insects fruit flies undergo complete metamorphis, meaning that their life cycle is made up by four distinct stages: egg, larvae, pupae and adult. Every transition from one stage to the next is an important bottleneck in development. Thus de- or ascelerations of the life cycle indicate biological relevancy.

The paper asseses the time between transition from larvae to pupae and pupae to eclosion (= emergence of the adult fly), from what they conclude the duration of the following three "Stages" in development.

ID | Stages
-|-
L-P | first instar larvae to first pupation
P-E | first pupation to first eclosion
L-E | first instar larvae to first eclosion

### 3. Metabolic Pools

Lastly the paper looks at metabolic markers, specifically the dry weight, protein and triglyceride (TGA) content. Triglycerides in particular play an important role in regulating metabolism in development of *Drosophila melanogaster*. In short dietary sugars are utilized to synthesis TGAs to store energy later to be mobilized during development when individuals are not actively feeding i.e. late larval and all pupal stages.

Protein and TGA content were determined with standard colorimetric assays. For these 5 flies are pooled to reach suffient concentrations and also reduce noise. The dry mass is also determined for these 5 flies (= 1 homogenate).


## Goals

### Data Manipulation

In all tables you will find the mean per group as well as the standard deviation (SD) for each measurement. While this is not the most elegant to work with, I'd like you to keep the SD as a rough measurement for variance.

All three characteristics (Survival, Developmental time and the metabolic pools) are kept in slightly different table formats, which stays true - though slightly more pointed due to my hand - to the original presentation in the publication. First I'd like you to combine the three tables into one conise table, so that the values for all measurements are easily findable from giving any combination of the three characteristics (dietary composity, genetics and sex). So you will have to reformat the individual tables to a singular format. What this format will look like, I will leave to you. 

So in short: Compile data into a more easily acessible format.

### Visualization

This was one of my big caviates with this paper: I think the visualization here could be much improved. I am not a fan of barplots, so that's the one thing I'd ask you to avoide. Boxplots are the obvious answer here and please do use them plenty, but I would be interested, if you can find a nice way to include multiple measurements into one plot e.g. developmental time and survival or metabolic.

The overarching question I'm asking about the paper is basically if any of the measurements are "related", meaning that e.g. protein content can predict TGA content. Also rather than just looking at the mean of each measurement, I am interested if the variance (by SD here) behaves in a similar way.
