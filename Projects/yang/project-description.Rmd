## Introduction
- describe features of first names globally.
- For example, the frequency of specific names in different countries (e.g., "Antonio" in Italy vs. Spain); the overlap of first names between neighboring countries (e.g., Germany and Austria).

## Dataset
- Name Census dataset, which contains the top 100 first names per country
- Dataset source: [Kaggle Name Census](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/namecensus/first-name-database?resource=download)

## Data manipulation goal:
- Data cleaning: neat, not so necessary.
- Data wrangling: group by based on name, continent, country or some other feature. 

## Data Visualization:
- explore the geographic distribution of some names
- present some descriptive features of names.
