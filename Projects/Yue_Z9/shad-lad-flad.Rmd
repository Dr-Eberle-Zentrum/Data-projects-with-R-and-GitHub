# Task 1


#### Grouping the different pollutants in "Name" and calculating the mean value for each one

```{r, warning=FALSE}

 airquality %>%
  select(Name,Measure,Measure.Info,Data.Value)%>% 
  group_by(Name) %>%
  mutate(Measure.Info = gsub("\\?", "", Measure.Info)) %>%
#joining the Name and Measure.Info columns to display the units  
  mutate(Name = paste(Name, Measure.Info, sep = " || ")) %>%         
#using "summarise" instead of "mutate" here, so the values in the chart are displayed correctly.
  summarise(mean_value =as.numeric(round(mean(Data.Value, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1))) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
   
#Visualization of the Plot using "geom_bar()"
  
  ggplot(aes(x = Name, y = mean_value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +         # adding "identity" so the graph displays at all
  labs(title = "Mean Value of Pollutants",y= "Mean Value", x= NULL) +
  geom_text(aes(label = mean_value, ), hjust = -0.5)+ 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, xend = 0.5, yend = 125), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "inches")) ) +
  expand_limits(y = c(0, 120)) +              #adding a limit to the y axis so the text fits in
  coord_flip()                                # flipping the chart to fit in the names with the values
  


```

```
- Since the Legend wouldn't build up like I intended to, I've decided to flip the chart in Order to make it more readable.

- The units for each observation are displayed together with its Name and separated by "||".

# Task 2


#### finding out which regions have the highest pollution on average for $\frac{\mu g}{m^3}$ measurements


```{r}
top3_pollution <- airquality %>% 
  arrange(Name, Geo.Place.Name, Start_Date, Time.Period) %>%
  filter(Measure.Info == "mcg/m3") %>% 
  group_by(Geo.Place.Name) %>%
  summarise(mean_value = mean(Data.Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_value)) %>% 
  head(3) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  print() 
```

##### Results show that the top 3 regions with the highest pollution on average are: 
- Midtown (CD5)
- Gramercy Park - Murray Hill
- Chelsea - Clinton

### creating the time series for the top 3 areas mentioned above


```{r, warning=FALSE}
airquality %>% 
  filter(Measure.Info == "mcg/m3") %>% 
  inner_join(top3_pollution, by = c("Geo.Place.Name" = "Geo.Place.Name")) %>%
  
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(as.Date(Start_Date, format="%d/%m/%Y"), "%Y"))) %>%
  arrange(year, Geo.Place.Name) %>% 
  group_by(Geo.Place.Name) %>%
  
  # time series visualization using "geom_line()"

ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Data.Value, color = Geo.Place.Name)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Top 3 polluted Areas on average", x = "Year", y = "Yearly Value (mcg/m3)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Midtown (CD5)" = "red", "Gramercy Park - Murray Hill" = "blue", "Chelsea - Clinton" = "green")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(color = "Regions") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2010, 2022, by = 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 25, by = 2))
