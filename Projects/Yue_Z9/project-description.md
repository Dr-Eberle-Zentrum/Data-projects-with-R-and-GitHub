# General Topic

Dataset contains information on New York City air quality surveillance
data. Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threats
to urban populations and while all people are exposed, pollutant
emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability vary across
neighborhoods. These indicators provide a perspective across time and
NYC geographies to better characterize air quality in NYC.

# The Dataset

The
[Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality/resource/f3ed1638-92da-4f88-bb6b-7d3940514574)
has been published by Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) on
the Open-Data. The dataset consists of csv/rdf/json/xml file with 12
attributes.

# Manipulation Goals

The variety of data types can lead to a number of different analytical
directions, such as temporal changes of a pollutant in different
regions, or comparing mean values of different pollutants.

# Visualization Goals

I mainly want to compare the mean values of different pollutants. This
can be done by calculating the mean value of each pollutant in the data
and then plotting a [graph](~/Projects/Yue_Z9/description.jpg) to show.
