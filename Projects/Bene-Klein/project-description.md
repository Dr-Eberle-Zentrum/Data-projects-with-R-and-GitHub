## Introduction

As we have seen in January wildfires are a real thread to nature on a
huge scale. Thus I’d like you to analyse the rate at which the
Treecoverage in each country is beeing affected.

## Dataset

The data set can be downloaded here
[data.xlsx](https://gfw2-data.s3.amazonaws.com/country-pages/country_stats/download/gfw_2023_statistics_summary_v30102024.xlsx).

## Data manipulation

The data is very cleaned up therefore little to no cleanup has to be
made. I’d like the data to be extrapolated for the loss of tree coverage
until 2050. Also the difference of the extrapolated function and the
real data has to be calculated.

## Visualisation goal

I’d like a visualization of a worldmap on which each country is color
coded on how much tree coverage in relation to the entire countrys area
has been destroyed in 2023. furthermore I’d like you to make predictions
onm how much tree coverage is gonna bee destroyed in the year 2030 via
extrapolation.
