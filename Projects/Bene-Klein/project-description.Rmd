## Introduction

As we have seen in January wildfires are a real thread to nature on a huge scale.
Thus I'd like you to analyse the rate at which the Treecoverage in each country is beeing affected.

## Dataset
The data set can be downloaded here [data.xlsx](https://gfw2-data.s3.amazonaws.com/country-pages/country_stats/download/gfw_2023_statistics_summary_v30102024.xlsx).

## Data manipulation
The data is very cleaned up therefore little to no cleanup has to be made. 
I'd like the data to be extrapolated for the loss of tree coverage until 2050.
Also the difference of the extrapolated function and the real data has to be calculated.

## Visualisation goal
I'd like a visualization of a worldmap on which each country is color coded on how much tree coverage in relation to the entire countrys area has been destroyed in 2023.
furthermore I'd like you to make predictions onm how much tree coverage is gonna bee destroyed in the year 2030 via extrapolation.
