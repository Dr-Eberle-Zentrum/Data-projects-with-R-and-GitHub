## Introduction

As we have seen in January wildfires are a real thread to nature on a huge scale.
Thus I'd like you to analyse the rate at which the Treecoverage in each country is beeing affected.

## Dataset
The data set can be downloaded here [data.xlsx](https://gfw2-data.s3.amazonaws.com/country-pages/country_stats/download/gfw_2023_statistics_summary_v30102024.xlsx).
The dataset I am interseted is located on the second page named "country tree coverage loss"\
The columns are as follows:\
1. country: Name of the country\
2. threshold: canopy cover in 2000 (Read_Me)\
3. area_ha: Area of the country in hectare\
4. extent_2000_ha \
5. extent_2010_ha\
6. gain_2000-2020_ha:\
7.-29. tc_loss_ha_2001 -	tc_loss_ha_2023: loss of treecoverage in the given year in hectare\

## Data manipulation
Please rearrange the dataset by only considering the 30% threshold data and the columns should look smth like this:\
1. country: Name of the country\
2. area_ha: Area of the country in hectare\
3.-25. tc_loss_ha_2001 -	tc_loss_ha_2023: loss of treecoverage in the given year in hectare\
26. expected_tc_ha_2050: please make a fit (2nd degree polynom (3 parameters)) of the tc_loss_ha 2001-2023 data and output the data for your calculated 2050 here.\
27. var_expected_tc_ha_2050: please add the variance of the of the previous value\
28. R_squared: please add the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) of the fit \

## Visualisation goal
For confirmation of the of your fit I'd like a simple xy dotplot with the data and fit of a country your choosing.\
I'd like a visualization of a worldmap on which each country is color coded on how much tree coverage in relation to the entire countrys area has been destroyed in 2023.
