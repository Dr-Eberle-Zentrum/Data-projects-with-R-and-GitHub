# Nicos solution on Tabeas project

## The first plot

The exercise was: Scatterplot with the mean radius size of each sample
in which only the samples with Radius\_number 1 are considered.
Differentiation between different taxa, colour gradient from smaller to
larger diameter.

## The second plot

Then I tried the next exercise: A barplot in which the number of samples
with the different numbers of annual rings is shown.

## The third plot

Last exercise: Scatterplot with dependence of standard deviation on the
mean value of the radius, differentiated by taxa, including for each
taxa a linear trend line.
