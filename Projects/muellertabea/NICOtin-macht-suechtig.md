# Nicos solution on Tabeas project

\###The first plot: The exercise was: Scatterplot with the mean radius
size of each sample in which only the samples with Radius\_number 1 are
considered. Differentiation between different taxa, colour gradient from
smaller to larger diameter.

\###The second plot: Then I tried the next exercise: A barplot in which
the number of samples with the different numbers of annual rings is
shown.

\###The third plot: Last exercise: Scatterplot with dependence of
standard deviation on the mean value of the radius, differentiated by
taxa, including for each taxa a linear trend line.
