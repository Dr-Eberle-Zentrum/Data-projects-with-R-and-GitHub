## Data
The [Auto]("https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/blob/main/Projects/Hamed/Auto_data.csv") dataset is a collection of various automobile models and their characteristics. It contains quantitative and qualitative variables describing different aspects of cars such as fuel efficiency, engine size, weight, acceleration, and more. The dataset is useful for exploring regression modeling, correlation analysis, and data visualization.

Observations: 396 cars

Variables:

mpg: Miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)

cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine

displacement: Engine displacement (cubic inches)

horsepower: Engine horsepower

weight: Vehicle weight (pounds)

acceleration: Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (seconds)

year: Model year (last two digits)

origin: Origin of the car (1 = American, 2 = European, 3 = Japanese)

name: Car name (manufacturer and model)


### Data preparation  

*Ensure each variable has its own column and each observation its own row.

*Convert categorical variables into factors with descriptive labels.

*Identify and report any duplicate rows in the data set.

*Discuss whether duplicates are meaningful or should be removed.

*Identify columns with missing values

*Summarize the number and percentage of missing values.

*Decide on how to handle missing values.

*create a new variable Compute power to weight ratio and store it in the new column.


### Data visualization

*investigate the relation of mpg vs horsepower and  weight vs acceleration

*do some trend analysis with respect to mpg, horsepower and acceleration over years Highlight changes in car characteristics over time  

*what is the correlation between numerical variables ? show it in a suitable plot 

### Results

*Report a general overview and results answer these question:

*Which origin has the most powerful or fastest cars?

*What is the relationship between number of cylinders and acceleration?

*What is the fastest car each year? 

*Feel free to add more information in your report based on your analysis
