# Topic of the project  
Dragonflies are flight-active insects whose behavior is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. In this project, the flight activity of the autumn mosaic dragonfly (*Aeshna mixta*) is linked to meteorological data to find out **under which weather conditions this species prefers to fly**.

# Data sets for the project 
The two data sets were provided directly by the operators of the fishing station in Bukowo, Poland.

## Weather data from the weather station at the fishing station in Bukowo in Poland

# Catch data for the dragonflies

# Goals for data manipulation of weather data 
1. Cleaning up the weather data:

1.1 Remove the row with the unit declaration 

1.2 Extraction and renaming of the following columns: 

- Time -> Time in yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss

- Temp. -> Temperature in Celsius 

- Wind Speed -> Wind speed in m/s

- True Dir. -> Wind direction in degrees

1.3 Separation of the time column into two columns (date and time)

1.4. Form mean values from the extracted and revised weather data for the morning (10 a.m. to 2 p.m.) and midday (2 p.m. to 4 p.m.) periods 

1.5. Creation of a new column based on the wind direction in degrees (True Dir.) with the wind direction in compass direction (e.g. NW, SSO)
 
2. Merging the data from the revised weather file with the dragonfly catch data 

# Goals of the visual representation of the data
- Display the temperature values for the two daily periods as a trend line with an error corridor over the entire catch period. 
- Display the temperature values of the individual catches with the ID of the dragonflies to order in a small extrapolation over the entire catch period.
- Display the number of catches of dragonflies as stacked bars by sex over the entire catch period
- Display the wind direction as compass direction with arrow and designation below the diagram as well as the wind speed in m/s
