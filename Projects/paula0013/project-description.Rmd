# Topic of the project  
Dragonflies are flight-active insects whose behavior is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. In this project, the flight activity of the autumn mosaic dragonfly (*Aeshna mixta*) is linked to meteorological data to find out **under which weather conditions this species prefers to fly**.

# Data sets for the project 
The two data sets were provided directly by the operators of the fishing station in Bukowo, Poland.

## Weather data from the weather station at the fishing station in Bukowo in Poland

# Goals for data manipulation of weather data 
1. Cleaning up the weather data:

1.1 Remove the row with the unit declaration 

1.2 Renaming the columns with clear names and units

1.3 Separation of the time column into two columns (date and time)

1.4. Summarizing the data per day with the mean values  

1.5. Creation of a new column based on the wind direction in degrees (True Dir.) with the wind direction in compass direction (e.g. NW, SSO)
 
2. Merging the data from the revised weather file with the dragonfly catch data 

# Goals of the visual representation of the data
- Display temperature values as a line over the entire catch period 
- Display the number of catches of dragonflies as stacked bars by sex over the entire catch period
- Display the wind direction as compass direction with arrow and designation below the diagram as well as the wind speed in m/s
