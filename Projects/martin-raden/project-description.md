# Reproduce this super nice chart!

It is often that you find a chart that you really like but have no idea
how to do. An example might be the following one.

<img src="Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png" style="width:50.0%" />

Which is shown and detailed on
[https://ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/europe-mammal-comeback).

The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible
using `ggplot` and the data available in the provided [CSV
file](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv)

Visualization priorities (from high to low are)

-   line style with animal name labels
-   percent labels at line ends
-   time range label at line start
-   x-axis marks
-   arrow line style
-   annotation of brown bear
-   text coloring
-   relative font sizes
-   animal symbol for brown bear

Letâ€™s see how close you can get! As a starting point, you might want to
have a look at [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/).

Looking forward to see your solutions!

Best, Martin
