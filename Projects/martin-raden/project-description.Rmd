# Reproduce this super nice chart!

It is often that you find a chart that you really like but have no idea how to do.
An example might be the following one.


[![](Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png){ width=50% }](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png)

Which is shown and detailed on [https://ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/europe-mammal-comeback).

## Goal of the project

The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible using `ggplot` and the data available in the provided [CSV file](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv) with the following content (first lines):

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
knitr::kable(
  read_csv("https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv",
           show_col_types = F)[1:5,]
)
```

### Visualization priorities (from high to low)

- line style with animal name labels
- percent labels at line ends
- time range label at line start
- x-axis marks
- arrow line style
- annotation of brown bear
- text coloring
- relative font sizes
- animal symbol for brown bear

Let's see how close you can get! As a starting point, you might want to have a look at [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/).

Looking forward to see your solutions!

Best,
Martin
