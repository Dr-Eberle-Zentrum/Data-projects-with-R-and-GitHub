# Project Overview

## About the Data {.scrollable}

-   Behavioral data from Kalbe & Schwabe (2022)

-   Investigates emotional experiences and their effect on memory

-   Examined memory performance in participants exposed to conditioned and non-conditioned stimuli

## Experimental Design {.scrollable}

-   Initially neutral stimuli: images of animals and tools

-   Categories

    -   $CS+$: image category associated with aversive event
    -   $CS-$: image category not associated with aversive event

# Data Manipulation

## Key Variables {.scrollable}

-   *study_id* : The number of the experiment

-   *participant_id* : The ID number of the participant

-   *condition* : The category of the item

    -   CSm
    -   CSp

-   *phase* : The phase of the experiment during which the items were first presented

    -   conditioning
    -   post-conditioning
    -   pre-conditioning

-   *hit* : Hit rate

-   *fa* : False alarm rate

## Data Processing {.scrollable}

1.  Import `.csv` files into R environment using `read_csv()`
2.  Pool experiment datasets
    -   Ensure each participant has a unique ID across the experiemnts
3.  Compute "Corrected Recogniton" as a new variable
    -   `CR = hit - fa`

## Data Visualization {.scrollable}

**Goal**: Recreate *Figure 3* from Kalbe & Schwabe (2022)

![This is *Figure 3* from Kalbe & Schwabe (2022)](images/figure03_Kalbe_Schwabe_2022.png)

## Data Visualization {.scrollable}

-   Create multiple panel plot
    -   You can use `facet_grid` or `facet_wrap` function from the `ggplot2` package
    
-   Map the *phase* to the x-axis and *corrected recognition* to the y-axis

-   Add individual data points over the bars

-   Optional: add the p-values
