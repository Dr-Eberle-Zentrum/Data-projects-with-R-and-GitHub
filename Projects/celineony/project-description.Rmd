# Project Description

## Data Set

This project will use publicly available behavioral data from Kalbe & Schwabe (2022). The unprocessed data can be found [here](https://osf.io/qpm3t/), the prepocessed data, can be found in the folder ['project-data'](~/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/Projects/celineony/project-data).

**Data Manipulation**

-   Read the data into your local R environment

-   Compute corrected recognition scores

    -   Corrected recognition is computed by subtraction false alarms from hits

-   To store corrected recognition scores you have to create a new variable / column

**Visualization**

[Here you can find the published paper](https://www.psy.uni-hamburg.de/arbeitsbereiche/kognitionspsychologie/publikationen/kalbe-2021-journal-experimental-psychology.pdf). Have a look at *Figure 3*. Try to recreate the figure using the provided data. You can choose which of the four experiments you want to plot.
