## Introduction

In this analysis, we explore recognition performance expressed as the
hit rate minus the false alarm rate (corrected recognition) across four
experiments. Participants underwent three phases: pre-conditioning,
conditioning, and post-conditioning. The study contrasts two conditions,
CS+ (Conditioned Stimulus Positive) and CS− (Conditioned Stimulus
Negative), to evaluate their influence on recognition performance. The
visualization provides insights into mean corrected recognition and
individual participant variability for each experiment.
