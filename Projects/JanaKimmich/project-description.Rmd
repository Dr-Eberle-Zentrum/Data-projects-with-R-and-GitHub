# Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to display the top ten formula one drivers in the range
of the years 2000-2020. "Top" in this case is for simplicity defined as the count of
the races that a driver won over the years. The chart should also contain the information 
in which year the driver drove for which constructor, his nationality and how many races
he won in that special year.

The data is from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020).

The chart should look something like this (and be interactive :D):

The box shows a tooltip, meaning, if one hovers over the bar at a specific place, the tooltip with
the information shows up. For this, the package [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) might be useful.

# Visualizaion priorities (high to low)
- bar chart with x-axis and y-axis as displayed above
- tooltip (when hovering over the bar, show the name and the nationality of the driver)
- bar colored according to the constructor the driver worked for in the corresponding year and add
the information to the tooltip
- bar separated according to years (does not have to be visible, only important for the tooltip, add the year
and the count of the races won in this year to the tooltip)
- formula one font type
- clicking on bar to open wikipedia page of driver
