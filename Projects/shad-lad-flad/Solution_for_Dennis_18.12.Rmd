library(ggplot2)
```

Reading the data, and cleaning from na values
```{r}
dat <- read.csv2("wows_playerbase_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dat <- dat[!apply(dat == "-", 1, any), ]
 #dropping rows where we have "-" instead of actual value
```


Since we are going to use the values from tables Battles, Avg.Damage, and Win.rate, I am removing any white spaces, percentage values and making them numeric. 
```{r}
dat$Battles <- gsub(" ", "", dat$Battles) 
dat$Avg..damage <- gsub(" ", "", dat$Avg..damage) 
dat$Win.rate <- gsub("%", "", dat$Win.rate)  
dat$Win.rate <- gsub(" ", "", dat$Win.rate)

dat$Battles <- as.numeric(dat$Battles) 
dat$Avg..damage <- as.numeric(dat$Avg..damage) 
dat$Win.rate <- as.numeric(dat$Win.rate) 
```




Restrictions: Data cleaning for necessary information only:
```{r}
dat_grouped <- dat %>% 
  filter(
    Tier >= 3 & Tier <= 10,    # Exclude ships below Tier 3 and above Tier 10 
    Battles >= 200000,         # Exclude ships with fewer than 200 000 battles
    !(Type %in% c("Submarine ", "Aircraft Carrier "))  # Exclude Submarines and Aircraft Carriers
  ) %>% 
  group_by(Nation, Tier, Type) %>%  # Group by Nation, Tier, and Ship Type
  filter(Battles == max(Battles, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%  # Keep only the ship with the max Battles per ship type
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(Nation, Tier) %>%  # Group by Nation and Tier again
  mutate(ship_type_count = n_distinct(Type)) %>%  # Count distinct ship types within each Nation and Tier
  filter(ship_type_count >= 2) %>%  # Keep only nations with at least 2 ship types present in a tier
  mutate(  # Add necessary columns using mutate
    total_battles = sum(Battles, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum of battles for each Nation and Tier
    avg_winrate = mean(Win.rate, na.rm = TRUE),  # Average win rate for each Nation and Tier
    avg_damage = mean(Avg..damage, na.rm = TRUE),  # Average damage for each Nation and Tier
    max_battles = max(Battles, na.rm = TRUE)  # Max battles per ship type
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() 
  

dat_grouped
```



Contest. Awarding Points: 

```{r}
dat_points <- dat_grouped %>%
  # Group by Tier and Ship Type to evaluate the ship types across nations within the same tier
  group_by(Tier, Type) %>%
  # Find the nation(s) with the maximum number of battles for each ship type within each tier
  mutate(max_battles = max(Battles, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  
  # Assign points to the nations that have the highest battles in the tier for each ship type
  mutate(battle_points = case_when(
    Battles == max_battles ~ 1,        # Assign 1 point to the nation with the highest battles for this ship type
    TRUE ~ 0   # No points for other nations or ship types
  )) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Summarize the total points per nation and tier
  group_by(Nation, Tier) %>%
  summarise(
    total_battle_points = sum(battle_points, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up the points awarded for each ship type
    .groups = "drop"  # Drop grouping after summarizing
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

dat_points
```




```{r}
# Top 3 Nations based on total battle points
top_3_nations <- dat_points %>%
  group_by(Nation) %>%
  summarise(total_points = sum(total_battle_points, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_points)) %>%
  head(3)  # Get the top 3 nations

top_3_nations
```


```{r}
# Top Ship (Ship with the highest battle points for each nation and tier)
top_ship <- dat_points %>%
  group_by(Nation, Tier) %>%
  filter(total_battle_points == max(total_battle_points, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()  

top_ship
```


```{r}
# Accumulating points per nation from lowest to highest tier
dat_points_accumulated <- dat_points %>%
  arrange(Nation, Tier) %>%  # Sort by Nation and Tier (from lowest to highest)
  group_by(Nation) %>% 
  mutate(accumulated_points = cumsum(total_battle_points)) %>%  # Calculate cumulative points per nation
  ungroup()

head(dat_points_accumulated)
```


Plot: option 1

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
ggplot(dat_points, aes(x = total_battle_points, y = Tier, fill = Nation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  # 'identity' to use actual values of total_battle_points
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Total Battle Points") +  
  labs(title = "Total Battle Points by Nation and Tier") +  
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +  # Apply the viridis color palette
  theme_minimal() +  # Minimal theme for clarity
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```


Plot: option2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)

  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +  # Stack the bars by Tier
  geom_text(aes(label = paste(Tier, ": ", total_battle_points)), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = "black", size = 3) +  # Add labels with Tier and battle points
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Total Battle Points") +  # Label for x-axis (Total Battle Points)
  scale_y_discrete(name = "Nation") +  # Label for y-axis (Nations)
  labs(title = "Total Battle Points by Nation and Tier") +  # Plot title
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +  # Apply viridis color palette for better visual clarity
  theme_minimal()
