# First draft of Dennis Project

This is my current progress on the project.

For now, I have used the **standard version** to count points (i.e., a
maximum of 3 points per nation in each tier).

However, I would like to implement your suggestions with **“Optional
Bonus Points”** and **“Optional Point Modifier”** because, as you can
see, in the standard option, there are only three countries that
received any points, and two of them even ended up with the same score.

I haven’t had any difficulties with the visualization so far. Contrary
to your example visualization, I decided against labeling the tiers and
instead added a gradual color scale, as I found it clearer. However, I
can change it again if needed.
