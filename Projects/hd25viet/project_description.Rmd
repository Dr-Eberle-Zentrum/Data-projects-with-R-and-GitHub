# Task description

## Introduction

This project explores the distribution of **classical chess ratings** across different age groups and countries using the official FIDE rating list from March 2025. The goal is to identify trends in rating strength by age, compare different federations, and analyze how age-based performance varies across regions. How do chess skills develop, and do certain federations have stronger youth or veteran players?

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [FIDE rating list Mar 2025](https://ratings.fide.com/download_lists.phtml).  We specifically use the **standard (classical) rating list** in the **fixed-width TXT format** provided on the website.

It contains numerical and categorical variables describing players' demographic characteristics, including:\
- **Player ID**: Unique identifier for each player\
- **Name**: Player’s full name\
- **Federation**: The country of the player\
- **Title**: GM, IM, FM, etc. (if available)\
- **Rating**: Current rating\
- **Birth year**: Year of birth (some values may be missing)

Since some records have missing values, **we will drop any entries with missing data** to maintain data integrity.

## Dataset Manipulation

To prepare the data for visualization, the following steps will be taken:\
1. **Loading Data Correctly**: The dataset will be loaded directly from the TXT file as a **fixed-width table** in R.\
2. **Cleaning missing values**: Entries with missing birth years or ratings will be removed.\
3. **Grouping players by age categories**: Creating bins such as:\
- Under 16\
- 16–24\
- 24–34\
- 35–45\
- 45+\
- (This column will be treated as a **factor** in R for proper categorical handling.)\
4. **Aggregating ratings by federation**:\
- Computing \*\* mean ratings\*\* for each country within each age group.\
- Creating an **RMarkdown table** where: - Rows represent federations. - Columns represent age groups. - An additional column shows the **overall mean rating** for each federation. - The table will be sorted either **by federation or by overall mean rating** (TBD).\
5. **Filtering federations for analysis**:\
- The focus will be on the **top 10 federations** ranked by **mean rating** (either across all players or within a specific age segment, TBD).

## Data Visualization

To analyze rating distributions across age groups and federations, we will use various visualization techniques:

-   **Ridgeline Plots** (formerly referred to as density plots):
    -   We will create **ridgeline plots** (as seen [here](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ridgeline-plot.html)), where the x-axis represents ratings and the y-axis represents different federations: One plot per federation, showing how different age groups compare within a country.\
    -   **Facetting** will be used to split visualizations into smaller, more readable plots.
-   **Heatmap Representation**:
    -   We will construct a **mean-rating-colored table** where:
        -   The y-axis represents **federations**.
        -   The x-axis represents **age groups**.
        -   The color intensity represents the **mean rating** for that age group in that federation.
    -   **Clustering will be applied only to federations**, ensuring that age groups remain in their natural order.
    - No strict color preferences, but a colorblind-friendly palette (e.g., viridis in R) will be used to improve accessibility.

These visualizations will provide insights into whether certain age groups dominate in specific federations, whether younger players outperform older ones consistently, and how the chess landscape differs across regions.
