## General Topic

This project aims to analyze promotion strategy by segmentation of customers. There is "Customer Shopping Trends Dataset". You have to segment those customers and analyze feature of each customer segments.

## The Data Set
The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset). You can download the full dataset on the website link that I provide or download the .csv file from my github repo.

## Manipulation Goals
You should make segment of customers by clustering. And then analyze each cluster's feature that is used in promotion strategy. You can get rid of clusters with extremely small amount of objects that is less meaningful then bigger one.

## Visualization Goals
After doing clustering and analyze the feature of these, you should visualize your clusters. If they have too many features to visualize, you can use PCA (that means you have to remain noticeable features to visualize in 2D dimension.) I'll attach the example of cluster visualization below. You can add comment in graph like striking features of each cluster.
