# Solution for the volleyball project

Unfortunately the circular bar plots do not contain much information,
since I could not resolve the issue how to know the team of the
topscores in the tables where they are not contained.

# Code for solving the project

The code for solving the project can be found
[here](https://github.com/Dr-Eberle-Zentrum/Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub/blob/volleyball_solution_from_Jana/Projects/laura-burk/volleyball-project/JanaKimmich.Rmd).
The datasets where not displayed properly, therefore it was neccessary
to read them in with a specific encoding.

As far as I understood the task, several plots for several teams where
desired:
