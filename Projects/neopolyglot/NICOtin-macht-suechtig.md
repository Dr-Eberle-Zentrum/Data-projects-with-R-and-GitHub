\#Pleasants project by Nico

Thanks to your nice project description it was really doable.

This is my plot:

![](NICOtin-macht-suechtig_files/figure-markdown_strict/plotting-1.png)

I had two little problems, I couldn’t solve (maybe you have some
ideas): 1. I wanted to put the picture of the andromeda galaxy also
behind the axes, but I think it doesn’t work with the function I used to
put the image in the background. 2. I couldn’t find a way to
automatically coloring the ascending part in a different way than the
descending part. I looked up the maximum myself and divided the plot
into two parts.

I hope you like my solution!

Greetings, Nico
