# Pleasants project by Nico

Thanks to your nice project description it was really doable.

This is my plot:

![](NICOtin-macht-suechtig_files/figure-markdown_strict/plotting-1.png)

I had two little problems, I could solve with Martins help:

1.  I wanted to put the picture of the andromeda galaxy also behind the
    axes, but It didn’t work with the function I used in the beginning.
    With the new function R doesn’t need to save the image as an object.

2.  I couldn’t find a way to automatically coloring the ascending part
    in a different way than the descending part. I looked up the maximum
    myself and divided the plot into two parts.Now the maximum is
    determined automatically.

I hope you like my final solution!

Greetings, Nico
