# Pleasants project by Nico

Thanks to your nice project description it was really doable.

This is my plot:

![](NICOtin-macht-suechtig_files/figure-markdown_strict/plotting-1.png)

I had two little problems, I couldn’t solve (maybe you have some ideas):

1.  I wanted to put the picture of the andromeda galaxy also behind the
    axes, but I think it doesn’t work with the function I used to put
    the image in the background.

2.  I couldn’t find a way to automatically coloring the ascending part
    in a different way than the descending part. I looked up the maximum
    myself and divided the plot into two parts.

I hope you like my solution!

Greetings, Nico
