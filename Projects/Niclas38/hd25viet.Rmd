It is not quite clear how to interprete "votes" as laymen ratings since "votes" reflect the amount of IMDb voting submissions by the users. Thus, "votes" rather reflects the general popularity of a genre of a specfic year. I normalized by the maximal amount of voting submission per year and genre with 10 corresponding to the most popular year of the genre.

```{r Plot of votes and rating, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
# Plot with facets and no legend
ggplot(genre_long, aes(x = YEAR, y = value, color = metric)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ GENRE, scales = "fixed", ncol = 4) + 
  labs(
    title = "IMDb Rating vs Normalized Audience Votes by Genre",
    subtitle = "Normalized votes (per year) and average IMDb rating over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Value",
    color = "Metric"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.93, 0),            # bottom right (x from left, y from bottom)
    legend.justification = c("right", "bottom"),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "cm")
  )
```
```{r Prepare actor stats}
actor_stats <- data_cleaned %>%
  filter(!is.na(RATING)) %>%
  unnest(STARS) %>%
  filter(!is.na(STARS)) %>%
  group_by(STARS) %>%
  summarise(
    appearances = n(),
    avg_rating = mean(RATING, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating))

actor_stats %>% filter(appearances>10) %>% head(20)

top_actors <- actor_stats %>%

Funnily, the guy from the ZDF heute-Show representing "Ulrich von Heesen" has the highest rating if restricted to >10 appearences.

```{r Plot top actors, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
ggplot(top_actors, aes(x = appearances, y = avg_rating)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = top5,
    aes(label = STARS),
    size = 3,
    box.padding = 0.4,
    point.padding = 0.3,
    segment.color = "grey50",
    max.overlaps = Inf
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Actor Performance: Appearances vs. IMDb Rating",
    subtitle = "Top 100 most active actors",
    x = "Number of Movies/Shows",
    y = "Average IMDb Rating"

The upper cluster are all "Dexter" actors.
