  group_by(GENRE, YEAR) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_rating = mean(RATING, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_votes = sum(VOTES, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(GENRE))

# Normalize votes within each year to [0, 1] scale
genre_scores <- genre_scores %>%
  group_by(GENRE) %>%
  mutate(norm_votes = 10*mean_votes/max(mean_votes)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Make long format: one column for metric type (rating or votes)
genre_long <- genre_scores %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(mean_rating, norm_votes),
               names_to = "metric",
               values_to = "value")
```

It is not quite clear how to interprete "votes" as laymen ratings since "votes" reflect the amount of IMDb voting submissions by the users. Thus, "votes" rather reflects the general popularity of a genre of a specfic year. I normalized by the maximal amount of voting submission per year and genre with 10 corresponding to the most popular year of the genre.

```{r Plot of votes and rating, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
# Plot with facets and no legend
ggplot(genre_long, aes(x = YEAR, y = value, color = metric)) +
  geom_line(alpha=0.5, linewidth = 0.8) +
  geom_point(size=0.3)+
  facet_wrap(~ GENRE, scales = "fixed", ncol = 4) + 
  labs(
    title = "IMDb Rating vs Normalized Audience Votes by Genre",
    subtitle = "Normalized votes (per year) and average IMDb rating over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Value",
    color = "Metric"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.93, 0),            # bottom right (x from left, y from bottom)
    legend.justification = c("right", "bottom"),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 7),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "cm")
  )
```
I emphasize that this plot using facetting gives much more insights about trends then the suggested plot containing all genres.

```{r Prepare actor stats, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
actor_stats <- data_cleaned %>%
  filter(!is.na(RATING)) %>%
  unnest(STARS) %>%
  filter(!is.na(STARS)) %>%
  group_by(STARS) %>%
  summarise(
    appearances = n(),
    avg_rating = mean(RATING, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating))

actor_stats %>% filter(appearances>10) %>% head(20)

top_actors <- actor_stats %>%
  slice_max(appearances, n = 100)



top5 <- top_actors %>%
  mutate(score = avg_rating * log1p(appearances)) %>%
  slice_max(score, n = 5)
```


```{r Plot top actors, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
ggplot(top_actors, aes(x = appearances, y = avg_rating)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = top5,
    aes(label = STARS),
    size = 3,
    box.padding = 0.4,
    point.padding = 0.3,
    segment.color = "grey50",
    max.overlaps = Inf
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Actor Performance: Appearances vs. IMDb Rating",
    subtitle = "Top 100 most active actors",
    x = "Number of Movies/Shows",
    y = "Average IMDb Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Note: In the previous version, several duplicated entries were present coming from redundant entries at IMDB. They are now merged. As a consistency check the threshold of 95 appearances seems to be reasonable for one actor. In particular, note that [Johnny Yong Bosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Yong_Bosch) works also as a voice actor.
