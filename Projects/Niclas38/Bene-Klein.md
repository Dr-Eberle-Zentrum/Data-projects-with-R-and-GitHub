# Data manipulation

Make the data set clean and tidy -&gt; 1 column = one variable, 1 row =
one observation, if there is no data -&gt; NA, always use the same
delimiter, watch out for commas that should not be read as a delimiter,
watch for spaces and Quotation marks etc.

\#Visualization

Plot the average imdb-score of each genre (group observation by genre)
against the time -&gt; which genre is the most liked by the judges, is
there a trend over the years? -&gt; Make a lineplot for each genre and
plot them all in the same graphic. Give every genre a different color,
make a legend. Sort the genres in the legend according to their current
imdb-score.

(=audience opinion) and compare the results of the two graphics
(discrepancy between “professional” and “laymen” taste).
