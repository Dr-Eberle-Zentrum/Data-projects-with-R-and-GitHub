### Project description and context
In order to characterize second language learners language proficiency, several types of language assessments can be used. One of these assessments is called Elicited Imitation Test (EIT),
a sentence repetition task that can measure general language proficiency as well as implicit knowledge of a language. During the test, the test-taker listens to recordings of sentences and has to repeat them verbatim. The tests can either be scored manually or by using different approaches, one of them being utilizing ASR for transcribing the test-taker response and calculating string edit distance (Isbell et al., 2023).
In this project, I'm interested in how scores on the EIT relate to fluency, for instance if "higher" fluency features indicate higher scores on the EIT.
Measuring fluency can be done automatically (de Jong et al., 2021) and the features are included in the dataset.

### Dataset
The dataset we will be working with is my own dataset- and the data was collected in March, so it's still a bit messy but should be ready to work with.  
The dataset contains responses of about 160 people who have taken an EIT, randomly assigned to five groups (which are indicated by test_component_id). Their responses are automatically
scored using edit distance and I've extracted the fluency features per answer. 
We can ignore most of the columns for this project. The columns we are focusing on are 

1. *speechrate*, *articulationrate*  which are two of the characteristics of fluency. Simply put, higher speech rate and higher articulation rate
indicate higher perceived fluency,

2. *user_id*, which is the participant number, and 

3. *distancelv*, which is the edit distance, in this case Levenshtein distance, between the transcription (what the participant said) and the correct sentence (what they should have said). The Levenshtein distance shows us how different these two strings are. In this dataset, the Levenshtein distance score is negated for comparison with other edit distance measures, which are not included in this dataset. There is a distancelv2 column, but all
this is still in progress as I'm currently working on aggregated scores. 

### Data manipulation goals

Since the edit distance values are negated, this might make visualization problematic, so feel free to transform them to positive values.
However, when doing this - higher scores then mean higher discrepancy from the target sentence so the more positive a score, the less
accurate a participant has repeated the sentence, which is a bit counter intuitive. 

### Visualization goals

A scatterplot grouped by participant condition (test_component_id) would probably look nice, something like this - but feel free to be creative:
