## Topic: Contemporary Germany

The project consists of an NLP investigation of contemporary German history through its political speeches. Assuming political discourse addresses the most pressing subjects of their time, we can use this data as a sample of the political climax of their time, trace the evolution of pudblic debate, and many other lines of research. 


## Data

Text data collected from German media since 1990. The aggregated data was updated in 2017. The corpus currently includes a total of **6,685 speeches by 71 speakers**, spanning a time from **1984 to 2017** and amounting to about **13 million words.** 

The files are accompanied with metadata encoded in XML format.

Here is the link. https://politische-reden.eu/

### Origin
Text repositories of speeches by:
- Official pages of the German Presidency, Chancellery, Bundestag, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
- Personal pages of the Helmut Kohl archive, Wolfgang Thierse and Norbert Lammert


## Data manipulation goals

Select by token or n-gram frequency what are the most important topics discussed in the las three decades and create a tabular dataset. The columns of the dataframe could include time-series data, categorical (speakers, context, topics, etc.), numerical (for quantitative analysis). 

Some data wrangling process will involve:
- Tokenize words
- Syntax encoding
- Stop-words deletion
- Frequency preiminary analysis
- Feature engineering to create a tabular dataset

## Visualization goals

- Word clouds
- time series anaysis and plots



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
