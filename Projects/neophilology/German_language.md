First, the data is imported. Here, I can use a subset of data, which
only includes the speeches of one german president, Roman Herzog.

A frequency diagram and a word cloud would be sufficient to paint a
bird’s eye view of the topics discussed in the aggregated speeches

After tidying the data, to only include somewhat relevant words, a
wordcloud is created. here, the words are arranged to fit smuggly
together, while the size should reflect their frequency

The frequency diagram started off as a simple barplot, but while
adjusting the labels of the words, this seemed to boring, and the words
were hard to read. They still are, kind of, but now it looks *way more*
interesting.
