\##Topic description

[dataset about
tennis](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/blob/master/atp_matches_qual_chall_2024.csv)
This data set contains some basic information about tennis tournaments,
such as tournament id, type of surface, winner’s name and loser’s name
etc. Through this data set, i can do categorization, analysis and
visualization.

\##data manipulation goals

First, the data need to be clean. Because it contains many NA in
everywhere. Second, there are too many columus, so How to create a
meaningful visualization with so many columns is also a challenge.

\##visualization goals

First, we can categorize the data by competition location to observe
what types of matches are held in each city. Then, we can classify the
competition surface. Additionally, we could analyze a player’s win rate
at different surface or examine a particular player’s win rate against
specific opponents.
