# Data-projects-with-R-and-GitHub


It is often that you find a chart that you really like but have no idea how to do.  
An example might be the following one (click to enlarge):

![Wildlife Chart](https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png)

Which is shown and detailed on [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org).

## Goal of the project

The idea of this project is to **recreate this plot as close as possible using `ggplot`** and the data available in the provided CSV file with the following content (first lines):

| Common name of species | Species name           | Number of mammal populations included | Start year | End year | Average relative change in abundance |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Eurasian beaver        | Castor fiber           | 98                                    | 1960       | 2016     | 16705%                               |
| European bison         | Bison bonasus          | 20                                    | 1960       | 2016     | 16626%                               |
| Grey seal              | Halichoerus grypus     | 18                                    | 1978       | 2016     | 6273%                                |
| Geoffroyâ€™s bat         | Myotis emarginatus     | 12                                    | 1974       | 2016     | 5392%                                |
| Iberian wild goat      | Capra pyrenaica        | 9                                     | 1966       | 2012     | 3502%                                |

## Visualization priorities (from high to low)

- line style with animal name labels  
- percent labels at line ends  
- time range label at line start  
- x-axis marks  
- arrow line style  
- annotation of brown bear  
- text coloring  
- relative font sizes  
- animal symbol for brown bear

***



 *Where do you get to the limits of normal Markdown ?*


  * Normal Markdown's limitations include a lack of rich media support, limited styling options, and a focus on text formatting, which can restrict its ability to create complex or interactive layouts. 
  *It also struggles with certain formatting features like indentation, centering, and color changes without relying on HTML. 
  *Furthermore, Markdown's simplicity can make it difficult to add semantic meaning or create features like nested tables, making it less suitable for highly structured or dynamic content. 

***

*What's (not) possible with normal Markdown?*

* Not possible
  * Data visualization (charts, graphs).
  * Dynamic content based on code.
  * Conditional logic or interactivity.
  * Custom styles (like CSS).
  * Inline images with logic (e.g., if conditions).
  * HTML widgets, sliders, or tabs
* Possible .
  * Basic text formatting (bold, italics, code).
  * Headers and subheaders.
  * Lists, tables, blockquotes, links.
  * Embedding static images via URL.


styling is an issue
