introduce shortly the general topic of your task (to put it in context)
introduce the data set(s), itâ€™s origin and important information of what-is-what, etc.
define data manipulation goals if needed (also fine if this is the main focus of the project!)
define the visualization goal(s) and possible intermediates

## Data Manipulation Goals
There are data of games for the USA Sitting Volleyball team and the University of Tulsa Volleyball team. The dataset contains the average number of passes made by the teams if they won the point or lost the point verses other volleyball teams of another country (China, Russia, Brazil, etc).

The data manipulation goals are to find the correlation between the number of passes and the number of points won or lost.


## Visualization Goals
I want a correlation graph between passing score and point win or loss.
