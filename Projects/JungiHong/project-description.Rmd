## Volleyball Passing- USA and TU


## Topic of task

The topic of the task is to analyze the volleyball passing data of USA and TU and see how the number of passes lead to a point win, or point loss . The data set is collected from the volleyball matches

## Data Set
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27560

## Data Manipulation Goals
There are data of games for the USA Sitting Volleyball team and the University of Tulsa Volleyball team. The dataset contains the average number of passes made by the teams if they won the point or lost the point verses other volleyball teams of another country (China, Russia, Brazil, etc).

The data manipulation goals are to find the correlation between the number of passes and the number of points won or lost.


## Visualization Goals
I want a correlation graph between passing score and point win or loss.
