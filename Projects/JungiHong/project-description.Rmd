## Volleyball Passing- USA and TU

### Topic of task

The topic of the task is to analyze the volleyball passing data of the USA Sitting Volleyball team and the University of Tulsa (TU) Volleyball team and determine how the number and quality of passes lead to a point win or point loss. The data set is collected from volleyball matches played by these teams.

### Data Set
[USA and TU Volleyball Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27560)

### Data Manipulation Goals
There are datasets for games played by the USA Sitting Volleyball team and the University of Tulsa Volleyball team. These datasets contain detailed information, such as:
- The average number of passes made by teams if they won or lost points.
- The quality of passes during games versus other volleyball teams (e.g., China, Russia, Brazil).

The key metrics tracked include:
- **Attempts**: Total passing actions made by the team, categorized by quality (e.g., low-quality "zeros," high-quality "threes").
- **Points**: The outcome following passing attempts, broken down into points won or lost. Not all passing sequences result in points scored, as points can also come from serves, opponent errors, or other play actions.

For example, in the University of Tulsa data:
- High-quality passes (e.g., "threes") had the highest success rate in terms of points won (141 out of 190 attempts, ~74%).
- Low-quality passes (e.g., "zeros") resulted in no points scored and 13 points lost.

The data manipulation goals are to:
- Investigate the relationship between passing attempts and point outcomes (won/lost).
- Find the correlation between the number and quality of passes and the number of points won or lost.

### Visualization Goals
The primary visualization goal is to create a correlation graph showing the relationship between passing score (quality of passes) and point outcomes (points won or lost). This will help illustrate how the quality and frequency of passing attempts impact overall performance.

#### 1. Stacked Bar Chart: Easy
- **Purpose**: To show the breakdown of points won vs. points lost for each pass quality (use data from file: “Volleyball Passing - USA and TU.xlsx TU sort by pass score).
- **X-Axis**: Pass score categories.
- **Y-Axis**: Total attempts (stacked into points won and points lost).
- **Highlight**: This graph would give a clear visual of the proportion of points won vs. points lost for each pass score.

#### 2. Scatter Plot with Trendline: Difficult
- **Purpose**: To visually show the relationship between passing scores and points won/lost, with the Pearson R value indicating the strength and direction of the correlation.
- **X-Axis**: Average passing scores (use data from in Directory: “Passing Raw Data” (totals tab)).
- **Y-Axis**: Points won or points lost
- **Highlight**: The scatter plot will show individual data points, and the trendline will indicate the correlation, with the Pearson R value represented in the graph's legend. A high Pearson R (close to 1 or -1) will show a clear upward or downward trend, while a low value (closer to 0) will show a more scattered distribution.
