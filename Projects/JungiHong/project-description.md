## Data Manipulation Goals

There are data of games for the USA Sitting Volleyball team and the
University of Tulsa Volleyball team. The dataset contains the average
number of passes made by the teams if they won the point or lost the
point verses other volleyball teams of another country (China, Russia,
Brazil, etc).

The data manipulation goals are to find the correlation between the
number of passes and the number of points won or lost.

## Visualization Goals

I want a correlation graph between passing score and point win or loss.
