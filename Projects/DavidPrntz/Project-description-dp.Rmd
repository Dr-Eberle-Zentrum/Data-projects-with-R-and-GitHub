# Marketing Analysis of Bigmart sales

## Project Description
Big Mart is Grocery Super Market Brand.
Grocery stores house thousands of products that you can find in many different locations and sizes. When considering their marketing, grocery stores can analyze different variables to see what products need to be promoted or offered discounts on. The BigMart dataset provides 14204 observations and 12 variables.These variables include weight, fat content, visibility, item type, location, and more. It also includes over 1,500 products across 10 different stores. The dataset can be downloaded on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/bigmart-product-sales-factors  

## Current Data
The Dataset has the following attributes: <p>
- `Item_Weight`	is the weight of the product in kilograms. *(Numeric)* <p>
- `Item_Fat_Content` is	the fat content of the product. *(Categorical)* <p>
- `Item_Visibility`	is the visibility of the product in store or online. *(Numeric)* <p>
- `Item_Type` is the type of product, such as limited offers or no offer. *(Categorical)* <p>
- `Item_MRP` is	the maximum retail price of the product. *(Numeric)* <p>
- `Outlet_Establishment_Year`	is the year the outlet was established. *(Numeric)* <p>
- `Outlet_Size` is the size of the outlet, either retail or supermarket. *(Categorical)* <p>
- `Outlet_Location_Type` is	the type of location of the outlet, such as urban or rural area. *(Categorical)* <p>
- `Outlet_Type` is	the type of outlet, such as sales departmental store or supermarket. *(Categorical)* <p>
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`	is the sales of the product in the outlet. *(Numeric)* <p>

## Goal
My aim is to evaluate the effects of the variables on purchasing behavior. 

First of all I need to **clean the data**. There are many missing values that needed to be converted to NA values along with some variables that are insufficiently written for future analysis. For example there are different spellings of fat content that need to be unified. 

After the Data Cleaning I would like to answer the following questions by **creating charts with ggplot**:

**1. Which products are sold the most?**

To answer this question I want to create a bar chart that shows the absolute number of all sales by item category. In addition, I want to show the relative share as a number above each bar.

*Example to illustrate* <p>

**2. Does this effect differ according to location, size, type of supermarket?**

To figure this out, I would like to create the same plot from 1. Separated by the attribute's location, size and type of supermarket. Using location type as an example, I would then have a plot showing total sales for location type tier 1, tier 2 & tier 3 split by item category. I would like to create these plots to show the influence of location, size and type of supermarket on sales. Additionally, I would like to create a plot for each of the same attributes showing the relative share of sales by item category within each location, size and type of supermarket category. I want to create these plots to explore how the share of each item category differs within the attribute categories. For example, "do baking goods have a similar share in all locations?".
