# Project Idea: Bye Bye Birdie

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biodiversity decline is a real problem around the globe. While for European audiences, the word normally conjures up images of rare orchids or reptiles in the world's rain forests, there is also biodiversity loss that hits a lot closer to home with a species that is considered omnipresent.

[According to research published in scientific journal Ecology and Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.8282), house sparrow populations in the European Union have almost halved between 1982 and 2017. The researchers estimated that between 2014 and 2017, the EU sparrow population only stood at around [261 million](https://zenodo.org/record/5544548#.ZFkcpi9n6x_).

Which is shown and detailed on <https://ourworldindata.org>.

## Goal of the project

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible using \`ggplot and the data available in the provided [CVS file](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/09/Mammal-comeback-in-Europe-data-OWID-download.csv) with the following content (first lines):

```{r}
knitr::kable( Mammaldata[1:5, ], )
```

\|Common name of species \| Species name \| Number of mammal populations included \| Start year \| End year \| Average relative change in abundance \| \|------------\|------------\|------------\|------------\|------------\|------------\| \| Eurasian beaver \| Castor fiber \| 98 \| 1960 \| 2016 \| 16705% \| \| \| \| \| \| \|

| European bison \| Bison bonasus \| 20 \| 1960 \| 2016 \| 16626% \|

| Grey seal \| Halichoerus grypus \| 18 \| 1978 \| 2016 \| 6273% \|

| Geoffroy's bat \| Myotis emarginatus \| 12 \| 1974 \| 2016 \| 5392% \|

| Iberian wild goat \| Capra pyrenaica \| 9 \| 1996 \| 2012 \| 3502% \|

### Visualization priorities (from high to low)

-   line style with animal name labels

-   percent labels at line ends

-   time range label at line start

-   x-axis marks

-   arrow line style

-   annotation of brown bear

-   text coloring

-   relative font sizes

-   animal symbol for brown bear![](https://dr-eberle-zentrum.github.io/Advanced-data-processing-with-R/Projects/martin-raden/icons8-bear-67.png)

Let's see how close you can get!

As a starting point, you might want to have a look at [The R Graph Gallery](%3C%20https://r-graph-gallery.com).
