## How to develop a function

- first think about `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` of your function, i.e. what do you need and what do you want to create
- `INPUT` will be all function arguments, i.e. the needed variables of your code
- create example variables with example content
- write a piece of code that operates on your example variables doing what you want, i.e. creating your `OUTPUT`
- wrap your working code in a `function(){}` construct/body and add a `return()` statement to provide your `OUTPUT`
- test your function with your example content as argument values
